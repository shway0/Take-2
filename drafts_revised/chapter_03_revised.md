# Chapter 3: The Betrayal

The inner disciples worked methodically to study the formation array, moving in careful patterns around the crater. Wei Liang watched from above, the containment vessel a heavy presence on his back. Its vibration had settled into a steady rhythm that seemed to match his heartbeat, creating a strange harmony that both disturbed and fascinated him.

From his vantage point, he could observe the entire operation. The crater was approximately fifty paces across, its walls smooth as polished jade. The formation array covered the entire floor, lines of light pulsing in complex patterns that shifted constantly. At the center stood the pedestal with its crystalline node—the object of their expedition.

Stone pillars arranged in concentric circles surrounded a central platform, each carved with symbols that glowed with faint, pulsing light. The entire structure was partially translucent, as if existing simultaneously in multiple reality layers. The air around the array carried a metallic taste, like blood on the tongue, and each breath seemed to vibrate against the lungs in an unnatural rhythm.

Feng Zhao directed the inner disciples with precise commands, guiding them through the array's defenses. They moved from pillar to pillar, applying spiritual energy in specific sequences that gradually altered the formation's patterns. Wei Liang observed with careful attention, noting how the inner disciples adjusted their formation to counter the array's effects. Feng Zhao led them in a specific pattern, moving from pillar to pillar in what appeared to be a predetermined sequence. Each correct step caused certain symbols to dim while others brightened, gradually opening a path to the center.

It was, Wei Liang realized, a lock—an ancient security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to whatever lay at the array's heart. Feng Zhao must have obtained the correct sequence from Elder Shen or sect records, knowledge that would be incredibly valuable and carefully guarded.

What fascinated Wei Liang most was how the array's script differed from conventional formation arrays. During his years of cleaning the sect's formation chambers, he had memorized hundreds of standard configurations. The elders who maintained those chambers had occasionally found him studying the patterns and, rather than punishing him, had sometimes explained basic principles—not out of kindness, but from the pride of craftsmen eager to have their work appreciated, even by a servant.

This array, however, inverted many of those principles. Where standard formations channeled energy inward to create stability, these seemed designed to project outward, as if the entire structure was meant not to contain power but to broadcast it across vast distances.

The inner disciples reached the center of the array after nearly an hour of careful navigation. They formed a circle around the pedestal, with Feng Zhao taking the primary position. Even at this distance, Wei Liang could sense its wrongness—the way it seemed to bend light and attention around itself, the eye sliding away unless forced to focus. The temperature near the crater's edge dropped noticeably, a cold that penetrated deeper than skin, reaching for the marrow of one's bones. The silence around the node felt deliberate, as if sound itself was being consumed by its presence.

As the inner disciples worked to disconnect the crystalline node from its pedestal, Wei Liang observed from the crater's edge, the containment vessel heavy on his back. Each flare of energy from the connection points sent ripples through the air that he could feel even at this distance—a wrongness that seemed to resonate with something inside him.

For a moment, a strange longing overtook him—not for power or recognition, but for belonging. Even here, in this corrupted place where reality itself was damaged, the inner disciples moved with purpose and connection. They belonged to something larger than themselves. They mattered.

Wei Liang's hands trembled slightly, and he clasped them behind his back to hide the weakness. What would it be like, he wondered, to be valued? To be mourned if he disappeared? To leave any mark at all on the world?

The thought threatened to unravel something essential within him—a carefully maintained distance from his own desires that had protected him for years. He forced his breathing to steady, focusing on the technical aspects of what he was observing rather than the hollow ache in his chest.

Feng Zhao gestured, and one of the inner disciples produced a set of specialized tools. Working with extreme caution, they began to disconnect the object from the pedestal, using spiritual energy to counter the occasional flares of power that erupted from the connection points.

Wei Liang noticed something unexpected—a momentary hesitation in Feng Zhao's movements. The inner disciple's hand paused above the node, his expression flickering with what might have been uncertainty or even fear. He glanced back toward Elder Shen's written instructions, then at the node again, as if confirming something.

"Is there a problem?" one of the other disciples asked.

Feng Zhao's confident mask returned instantly. "No. The resonance pattern is exactly as described in the texts." But Wei Liang had seen that flicker of doubt, that brief acknowledgment that perhaps they were dealing with something beyond their understanding.

The disconnection process continued, each connection point requiring specific techniques to neutralize. Wei Liang found himself holding his breath as the final connection was addressed. The containment vessel on his back vibrated more intensely now, as if responding to the node's imminent freedom.

With a final application of spiritual energy, the node detached from its pedestal. For a moment, it hovered in midair, suspended by nothing visible. Then Feng Zhao carefully maneuvered it into a temporary containment field generated by the inner disciples' combined power.

"Bring the vessel," he called to Wei Liang, not bothering to look up.

Wei Liang descended into the crater, following the same path the inner disciples had used to navigate the formation array. He moved with careful precision, placing his feet exactly where they had placed theirs. The formation responded differently to his passage—the lines dimming rather than brightening as he crossed them. If the inner disciples noticed this anomaly, they gave no sign.

He reached the center and knelt, removing the containment vessel from his back and presenting it with proper deference. Feng Zhao barely acknowledged him, focused entirely on the crystalline node floating within the temporary field.

"Open it," Feng Zhao commanded.

Wei Liang complied, releasing the seals that kept the vessel closed. The interior was lined with multiple layers of protective formations, each designed to neutralize different types of energy. At the center was a space precisely sized to hold the node.

As he watched, the crystalline node pulsed once, a subtle flare of energy that seemed directed... at him. A cold sensation washed over Wei Liang, as if something ancient had just taken notice of his existence. The air around him grew heavy with a presence that felt almost curious.

Wei Liang blinked, and the sensation vanished. None of the inner disciples appeared to have noticed anything unusual. He wondered if his mind was playing tricks on him—the Wastes were known to cause hallucinations and false perceptions. Yet the feeling of being observed remained, a prickling awareness at the base of his skull.

With careful coordination, the inner disciples guided the node into the containment vessel. Wei Liang watched as it settled into place, the protective formations activating automatically in response to its presence. The vessel hummed with contained power, the vibration now strong enough that the other disciples surely noticed it.

"Seal it," Feng Zhao ordered.

Wei Liang reactivated the seals, securing the node within its new prison. The moment the final seal engaged, a wave of energy pulsed outward from the vessel—subtle but unmistakable. The formation array beneath their feet flickered, as if momentarily disrupted.

Feng Zhao frowned. "What was that?"

"A resonance cascade," one of the other inner disciples suggested. "The texts mentioned it might happen during transfer."

Feng Zhao nodded, though Wei Liang could see lingering doubt in his expression. "We should leave quickly. The array may become unstable now that the node has been removed."

Wei Liang secured the vessel to his back once more, the weight now significantly increased by its contents. The hum had changed in quality, becoming deeper and somehow more insistent. It resonated with something inside him, creating a sensation he had never experienced before—a fullness where there had always been emptiness.

They ascended from the crater, rejoining the rest of the expedition at the perimeter. Feng Zhao announced their success, and a palpable sense of relief spread through the group. They had accomplished their mission and could now begin the journey home.

The return trip would be more dangerous than the approach. The Wastes were known to react to the removal of artifacts, the damaged reality becoming even more unstable in their absence. They would need to move quickly and maintain constant vigilance.

They departed immediately, retracing their path through the valley. Wei Liang found himself positioned near the center of the formation again, the containment vessel a constant presence against his back. Its vibration had settled into a rhythm that matched his heartbeat, creating an unsettling harmony.

They had traveled perhaps halfway back to the boundary when the first reality fissure appeared—a vertical crack in the air itself, revealing a glimpse of somewhere else. The expedition halted as the inner disciples assessed the danger.

"Minor fissure," Feng Zhao declared after a moment. "We can go around it."

They adjusted their course, giving the fissure a wide berth. Wei Liang studied it as they passed, noting how light bent around its edges and how sounds became distorted in its vicinity. The containment vessel's hum intensified as they approached, then diminished as they moved away.

More fissures appeared as they continued, each requiring detours that gradually pushed them off their planned route. The landscape grew increasingly unstable, with sections of ground occasionally phasing out of existence before reappearing moments later. The sky above shifted through impossible colors, and the air itself seemed to thicken and thin in unpredictable patterns.

They passed through areas where time itself seemed damaged. In one clearing, they observed a fallen tree simultaneously rotting into soil and growing from a sapling, its entire lifecycle visible at once. In another, they walked through a zone where their movements left persistent afterimages that faded only gradually, creating a forest of ghost-selves that mimicked their actions with decreasing fidelity.

Wei Liang noticed something the others seemed to miss—in these distorted areas, his own afterimages behaved differently. While the cultivators' images glowed with spiritual energy, his own appeared as darker silhouettes, almost like negative impressions. In one particularly strong distortion field, his afterimage seemed to absorb the light around it rather than emit it.

"Curious," Liu Mei murmured, having fallen back to walk beside him. "It's as if the Wastes respond differently to those without spirit roots."

Wei Liang nodded slightly, filing away the observation. The texts he had read mentioned nothing about this phenomenon, suggesting it was either too insignificant to note or deliberately omitted from sect records.

By late afternoon, they had been forced so far off course that Feng Zhao called a halt to reassess their position. The inner disciples gathered to consult the map, while the outer disciples maintained the protective formation. Wei Liang stood apart, the containment vessel a constant presence against his back.

Its hum had changed again, becoming more complex—almost like a voice speaking just below the threshold of hearing. He found himself straining to understand it, as if it were communicating in a language he almost knew.

"We need to adjust our course," Feng Zhao announced after the consultation. "The fissures are forming a pattern that's driving us south. We'll need to push through a less stable area to correct our heading."

The expedition reformed and continued, now moving directly toward a region where reality seemed particularly thin. The air shimmered like heat haze, and occasional flashes of other places could be glimpsed through momentary tears in the fabric of existence.

The inner disciples strengthened their protective formation, channeling more spiritual energy into the barrier. Even with this enhanced protection, Wei Liang could feel the wrongness of the place—a dissonance that made his teeth ache and his vision blur at the edges.

They were halfway through the unstable zone when disaster struck. A reality fissure appeared directly in their path, too suddenly for evasion. The expedition scattered, the formation breaking as disciples dove for safety. Wei Liang found himself thrown to the ground, the containment vessel a crushing weight on his back.

For a moment, chaos reigned. Disciples shouted warnings and instructions, their voices distorted by the fissure's influence. Wei Liang struggled to his feet, the vessel now vibrating so intensely that it threatened to shake itself free of its straps.

Through the confusion, he saw Feng Zhao organizing the inner disciples, attempting to reestablish the protective formation. The other disciples were regrouping, moving toward the relative safety of their leaders' spiritual energy.

Wei Liang began to follow, then hesitated. The containment vessel's vibration had changed again, becoming a specific pattern that seemed to pull him in a different direction. Without fully understanding why, he turned away from the group, taking a step toward the edge of the unstable zone.

"Wei Liang!" Liu Mei's voice cut through the chaos. "What are you doing? Stay with the group!"

He paused, suddenly aware of his actions. What was he doing? The vessel was influencing him somehow, guiding him away from safety. He turned back toward the expedition, fighting against the strange compulsion.

That's when he saw Feng Zhao watching him—not with the usual contempt, but with a calculating expression that sent a chill through Wei Liang's core. There was something in that look, a decision being made, that spoke of danger more immediate than any reality fissure.

The expedition regrouped, the protective formation reestablished. They continued through the unstable zone, moving with greater caution now. Wei Liang found himself positioned at the rear of the formation, separated from the other porters. Feng Zhao had ordered the change without explanation, and no one had questioned it.

They reached more stable ground by evening, finding a relatively secure location to make camp. The inner disciples established an enhanced protective barrier, anchoring it with more powerful talismans than they had used previously. Wei Liang was assigned a position at the very edge of the camp, as far from the center as possible while still remaining within the barrier's protection.

As he set up his small tent, he noticed Feng Zhao watching him again with that same calculating expression. The inner disciple then turned to speak quietly with two others, their conversation too distant to overhear. But their occasional glances in his direction made their subject clear.

Wei Liang completed his preparations for the night, his movements deliberate and unhurried despite the growing sense of danger. The containment vessel continued its strange communication, the vibration now forming patterns that almost resolved into meaning before dissolving again.

Night fell over the Wastes, bringing a darkness unlike any natural absence of light. This darkness had texture and depth, as if it were a substance rather than a condition. The protective barrier glowed faintly against it, a thin shell of order in a sea of chaos.

Wei Liang sat in his tent, the containment vessel before him. Its hum had quieted somewhat, though it still pulsed with contained power. He studied it, wondering what secrets it held—what knowledge or ability had made it valuable enough to risk an expedition into the Wastes.

More importantly, he wondered why it seemed to respond to him specifically. He had no spirit root, no cultivation ability. By all conventional understanding, he should be invisible to spiritual artifacts. Yet this one had noticed him, had attempted to communicate, had tried to guide him away from the expedition.

A shadow fell across his tent entrance—a figure blocking the faint light from the barrier. Wei Liang looked up to find Feng Zhao standing there, his expression unreadable in the darkness.

"Walk with me," Feng Zhao said, his tone making it clear this was not a request.

Wei Liang rose, securing the containment vessel to his back once more. He followed Feng Zhao to the edge of the camp, where the barrier separated them from the chaotic darkness of the Wastes. Two other inner disciples waited there, their hands resting casually on their spirit swords.

"You've noticed it, haven't you?" Feng Zhao asked without preamble. "The vessel responds to you."

Wei Liang kept his face carefully neutral. "This disciple has noticed some vibration from the vessel. It was assumed to be a normal function."

"Don't play the fool," Feng Zhao said, his voice hardening. "I've been watching you. The vessel reacts differently when you carry it. The formation array responded differently to your presence. Even the reality distortions affect you in unique ways."

Wei Liang remained silent. Any response would only confirm Feng Zhao's suspicions, whatever they might be.

"Elder Shen warned us this might happen," Feng Zhao continued. "The node seeks compatible vessels. Usually, that means powerful cultivators with specific spirit root configurations. But sometimes..." He studied Wei Liang with narrowed eyes. "Sometimes it means something else entirely."

One of the other inner disciples spoke up. "We should report this when we return to the sect. Elder Shen will want to examine him."

"No," Feng Zhao said, his decision apparently already made. "The risk is too great. We don't know what might happen during the journey back. The node has already tried to influence him once."

Wei Liang understood then, with perfect clarity, what was about to happen. The realization should have terrified him, but instead, he felt a strange calm descend. Perhaps he had always known his value to the sect was measured primarily in his expendability.

"This disciple has served as required," he said, the formal words falling from his lips for what would likely be the final time.

"Yes, you have," Feng Zhao agreed, drawing his spirit sword. The blade glowed with condensed wood energy, sharp enough to cut through stone. "And now you'll serve one last time, by not becoming a threat to the sect."

Wei Liang didn't run. There was nowhere to go—the Wastes on one side, three cultivators on the other. Instead, he stood straight, meeting Feng Zhao's gaze directly for perhaps the first time.

"You fear what you don't understand," he said quietly.

Anger flashed across Feng Zhao's face at this final defiance. "I fear nothing from a rootless nobody," he snarled, and thrust his sword forward.

The blade pierced Wei Liang's chest with surgical precision, driving through his heart and out his back. There was pain, bright and immediate, then a spreading coldness that raced through his limbs. He looked down at the sword protruding from his chest, the wood energy already disrupting his life force.

"Remove the vessel," Feng Zhao ordered the other disciples. "We'll tell the others he wandered outside the barrier and was lost to a fissure."

Hands pulled at the straps securing the containment vessel, roughly removing it from Wei Liang's back. As it separated from him, the vessel's hum rose to a shriek that only he seemed to hear—a protest, a denial, a promise.

Feng Zhao withdrew his sword with a practiced motion. Wei Liang fell to his knees, blood flowing freely from the wound. His vision began to darken at the edges, the world receding as death approached.

The inner disciples turned away, carrying the containment vessel back toward the camp. They didn't bother to finish him—the wound was mortal, and they were inside the Wastes. Nothing survived here without protection.

As consciousness faded, Wei Liang became aware of a strange sensation—a pulling, not from outside but from within. The emptiness where his spirit root should have been, the void that had defined his existence, was somehow expanding. It grew outward from his core, consuming the pain, consuming the cold, consuming even the darkness that threatened to engulf him.

With his last conscious thought, Wei Liang reached for that emptiness, embracing it rather than fighting it. If death was to be his fate, he would meet it on his own terms.

The world went dark. But it was not the end.

In the darkness, something stirred—something that had been waiting for precisely this moment, this conjunction of emptiness and opportunity. The containment vessel, now back in the camp, shattered with explosive force. The crystalline node within pulsed once, twice, then dissolved into a stream of energy that flowed not toward the nearest cultivator but toward the supposedly dead disciple at the camp's edge.

The last thing Wei Liang heard before consciousness fully fled was Feng Zhao's voice, raised in alarm and sudden fear: "What have you done?"

What indeed.
