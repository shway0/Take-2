# Chapter 2: The Expedition

Dawn broke over the Azure Peaks Sect, painting the sky in shades of amber and gold. Wei Liang had been awake for hours, preparing for the expedition. He had little to pack—a spare set of robes, a small knife for utility rather than combat, dried rations that would sustain him if the expedition's supplies ran low. Everything fit into a single cloth bundle that he secured to his back.

The expedition preparation hall buzzed with activity when he arrived. Inner and outer disciples moved with purpose, checking equipment and reviewing maps. Wei Liang stood just inside the entrance, waiting to be assigned his duties. No one acknowledged his presence.

Feng Zhao stood at the center of the hall, surrounded by a group of inner disciples. He was issuing instructions with the confidence of someone accustomed to command, his voice carrying easily through the space. Wei Liang listened carefully, gathering what information he could.

"The journey to the Wastes will take three days at a cultivator's pace," Feng Zhao was saying. "We'll establish a base camp at the boundary and proceed in teams from there. Our objective is to locate and retrieve a specific artifact from the eastern sector."

One of the inner disciples—a young woman with a fire spirit root, judging by the faint crimson glow around her hands—raised a question. "What kind of artifact are we seeking?"

"A control node from an ancient formation array," Feng Zhao replied. "Elder Shen will provide more details before we depart. For now, focus on preparations."

Wei Liang filed away this information. A control node—likely part of a larger system, perhaps one dating back to the cataclysm that had created the Wastes. Such artifacts were rare and valuable, often containing insights into cultivation techniques lost to time.

His thoughts were interrupted as Feng Zhao's gaze fell on him. The inner disciple's expression shifted to one of mild distaste.

"Ah, our rootless disciple has arrived," he announced, drawing attention to Wei Liang. "Come here."

Wei Liang approached, keeping his eyes appropriately lowered. He stopped at a respectful distance and bowed. "This disciple reports as instructed."

Feng Zhao gestured to a large pack on the floor. "You'll be carrying the containment vessel for the artifact. It's reinforced with multiple layers of protective formations, so even someone like you should be able to transport it safely."

The pack was easily twice the size of Wei Liang's bundle and appeared significantly heavier. He nodded and moved to examine it, testing its weight. As expected, it was substantial—designed for a cultivator who could use spiritual energy to offset the burden. For Wei Liang, it would be a physical challenge, but not an impossible one.

"The vessel must remain sealed at all times," Feng Zhao continued. "If you notice any changes in its condition—temperature fluctuations, unusual sounds, anything out of the ordinary—report immediately to me or another inner disciple."

"Understood," Wei Liang replied, securing the pack to his frame. The weight settled across his shoulders, pressing him downward. He adjusted his stance to compensate, distributing the burden as evenly as possible.

Feng Zhao watched with barely concealed amusement. "Try not to fall behind. We won't wait for you."

The message was clear—keep up or be left behind in one of the most dangerous regions in the world. Wei Liang had expected nothing less.

The hall doors opened, and Elder Shen entered. Conversation immediately ceased as all disciples turned and bowed to the venerable cultivator. She was ancient by mortal standards, her face a network of fine lines that spoke of centuries rather than decades. Yet she moved with the fluid grace of someone in their prime, her spiritual energy a palpable presence that filled the hall.

"Rise," she commanded, her voice surprisingly strong. "Gather around."

The disciples formed a semicircle before her, with inner disciples at the front and outer disciples—including Wei Liang—at the back. Elder Shen activated a projection formation with a casual gesture, displaying a map of the Shattered Wastes in glowing detail above her palm.

"The Shattered Wastes contain remnants from the divine war," Elder Shen continued, her voice dropping slightly. "Artifacts, formations, and entities that defy conventional understanding. Our objective is to locate and retrieve a specific control node from an ancient formation array."

She activated a projection formation, displaying a crystalline object shaped like a multifaceted gem. "This node is believed to contain valuable insights into reality manipulation techniques lost since the cataclysm."

As the projection rotated, Wei Liang felt a strange sensation—almost as if the image were looking back at him. A prickling awareness that raised the fine hairs on his arms. He glanced around, but no one else seemed to notice anything unusual. The feeling passed as quickly as it had come, leaving him to wonder if it had been his imagination or simply a reaction to the elder's ominous tone.

Elder Shen continued, "The node's location has been narrowed to a specific region in the eastern sector of the Wastes, approximately three days' journey from the boundary."

She expanded the map, highlighting an area where the terrain appeared distorted, as if the very geography refused to conform to normal rules. "This region is particularly unstable. Reality fissures are common, and the laws of nature are... flexible. Proceed with extreme caution."

Her gaze swept across the assembled disciples, lingering briefly on Wei Liang before moving on. "The expedition will be led by Inner Disciple Feng Zhao, who has been briefed on the specific protocols for artifact retrieval. Follow his instructions precisely."

Elder Shen closed her hand, dissolving the projection. "Remember your training. The Wastes do not forgive carelessness."

With those final words, she departed, leaving the disciples to complete their preparations. The hall erupted into activity once more, with final checks being conducted and last-minute supplies distributed.

Wei Liang adjusted the containment vessel on his back, testing how it would affect his movement. The weight was significant but manageable if he maintained proper posture. He had carried heavier loads during his years as a servant, though never for the extended period this expedition would require.

As the disciples began to file out of the hall, Wei Liang noticed Liu Mei—an outer disciple with a modest earth spirit root—watching him. Unlike most, she had occasionally shown him small kindnesses over the years, perhaps recognizing in him a fellow outsider. Her family was not from a cultivation background, making her advancement slower and more difficult despite her innate talent.

She approached now, her expression neutral but her eyes concerned. "That pack looks heavy," she observed quietly.

Wei Liang nodded slightly. "This disciple can manage."

Liu Mei glanced around to ensure no one was paying attention to their exchange. "The eastern sector is dangerous," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Stay close to the group, even if they try to drive you away. The boundary between life and death is thin there."

Before Wei Liang could respond, one of the inner disciples called for the outer disciples to assemble. Liu Mei moved away without another word, leaving Wei Liang to wonder at her warning. It wasn't the first he had received about the eastern sector—Yun Hua had mentioned it as well. The coincidence seemed significant.

The expedition departed from the sect's main gate, a procession of twenty disciples led by Feng Zhao. Six inner disciples, including Feng Zhao, formed the core team. Ten outer disciples with modest cultivation abilities would handle support tasks and perimeter security. The remaining four, including Wei Liang, were essentially porters—carrying equipment, setting up camps, and performing whatever menial tasks were required.

They moved at a cultivator's pace, using spiritual energy to enhance their speed and endurance. For the inner and outer disciples, this was effortless. For Wei Liang and the other porters, it meant pushing their bodies to the absolute limit, running until muscles screamed and lungs burned, then running further still.

By midday, they had covered a distance that would have taken ordinary travelers three days to traverse. The Azure Peaks were now distant silhouettes on the horizon behind them, and the landscape had changed from the cultivated forests of the sect to wild, untamed wilderness.

They paused briefly to rest and take water from a mountain stream. The inner disciples gathered upstream, while the outer disciples spread out along the banks. Their cultivation auras creating ripples of energy that pushed the sect's forgotten shadows further downstream along the banks.

Wei Liang found a spot downstream from everyone else and knelt by the water. He cupped his hands and drank deeply, the cold water soothing his parched throat. As he straightened, he caught sight of his reflection in the stream—a pale face with hollow cheeks, dark circles under watchful eyes, hair plastered to his skull by the earlier rain. He looked exactly what he was: a burden-bearer, a tool to be used and discarded.

For a brief moment, he allowed himself to feel the weight of it all—the ache in his muscles, the constant vigilance required to navigate the sect's hierarchy, the knowledge that tomorrow would bring more of the same. If he closed his eyes now and let the current take him, would anyone even notice his absence before they reached the Wastes? Would anyone search?

The thought came unbidden, shocking in its clarity. Wei Liang blinked, disturbed by the direction of his mind. He had survived this long by accepting his place, by finding small victories in the margins of existence. To falter now, when the expedition might offer new knowledge, new opportunities to observe cultivation techniques up close—it would be surrender of a different kind.

He splashed cold water on his face, washing away both the thought and the expression that might have betrayed it.

The rest period ended too quickly. At Feng Zhao's command, the expedition reformed and continued its journey. The path now led upward, leaving the valley and climbing into the foothills that separated the sect's territory from the wilderness beyond. The air grew thinner, carrying the metallic tang of mineral deposits and the sharp scent of pine. Each breath felt cleaner but somehow less substantial, as if the boundary between the physical and spiritual worlds was already beginning to thin.

By evening, they had reached a suitable location for their first camp—a relatively flat area sheltered by a natural rock formation. The inner disciples immediately claimed the most protected spots, while the outer disciples established a perimeter. Wei Liang and the other porters were tasked with setting up tents, gathering firewood, and preparing the evening meal.

Wei Liang was assigned the furthest position from the center—the least protected spot should danger approach during the night. He set up his small tent with methodical precision, then reported for his night watch assignment.

"Third watch," the duty roster keeper told him without looking up. "Northwest perimeter."

As Wei Liang turned to leave, he caught sight of Feng Zhao standing alone at the edge of camp, staring into the darkness beyond. For a brief moment, the inner disciple's confident posture faltered—shoulders tensing, hand moving unconsciously to the spirit sword at his belt. Something in the Wastes unsettled even him.

Then, as if sensing observation, Feng Zhao straightened and turned. His eyes met Wei Liang's across the camp, and the familiar contempt returned, hardened now with something that might have been resolve or fear. Wei Liang lowered his gaze and continued on his way, filing away the moment as potentially useful information.

The night passed without incident, though Wei Liang slept little. The containment vessel, which he had been instructed to keep with him at all times, emitted a faint hum that seemed to resonate with something inside him—a hollow space where a spirit root should have been. The sensation was not unpleasant, merely strange, like hearing an echo of a voice he couldn't quite identify.

Dawn brought renewed activity as the camp was dismantled and the expedition prepared to continue. The second day's journey took them through increasingly wild terrain—forests where the trees grew in impossible configurations, streams that flowed uphill, rock formations that seemed to shift position when viewed from different angles. These were the first signs of proximity to the Wastes, where reality itself had been damaged.

Wei Liang noted the subtle changes in vegetation as they progressed—how certain plants grew twisted in patterns that suggested spiritual corruption, how others thrived in ways impossible outside the Wastes. His years of cleaning the sect's greenhouses had given him an encyclopedic knowledge of spiritual flora, knowledge that Liu Mei had occasionally acknowledged when they crossed paths in the medicine hall.

"You see it too, don't you?" Liu Mei's voice startled him from his observations. She had fallen back from the main group, ostensibly to adjust her pack.

Wei Liang glanced at her questioningly.

"The spiritual resonance patterns in the plant growth," she clarified, keeping her voice low. "Most disciples wouldn't notice, but you've been cataloging them since we crossed the boundary."

He hesitated, then nodded slightly. "The distribution suggests the corruption flows in currents, like underground rivers."

Liu Mei studied him with renewed interest. "Elder Shen has a theory about that. She calls it 'reality erosion'—spiritual energy carving channels through the fabric of existence." She paused. "You should have been assigned to the medicine hall, not carrying water."

Before Wei Liang could respond, one of the inner disciples called Liu Mei forward. She gave him a final appraising look before rejoining the main group, leaving Wei Liang to wonder why she had shared such information with someone like him.

By midday, the landscape had changed dramatically. The natural world gave way to something that defied easy categorization—a realm where physical laws were suggestions rather than rules. Trees grew sideways from sheer cliffs, their branches reaching toward a sky that occasionally rippled like disturbed water. Rock formations twisted into impossible geometries, creating structures that hurt the eye to observe directly.

The expedition slowed its pace, proceeding with greater caution. The inner disciples formed a protective formation around the group, their spiritual energy creating a barrier against the Wastes' more harmful effects. Even with this protection, Wei Liang could feel the wrongness of the place—a persistent dissonance that made his teeth ache and his vision blur at the edges.

They made camp earlier than planned, finding a relatively stable area where reality seemed less fractured. The inner disciples established a more elaborate protective formation around the camp, anchoring it with talismans at cardinal points. Wei Liang observed the process carefully, noting the specific configurations and the way spiritual energy flowed between the anchor points.

Night in the mountains brought a profound silence that pressed against the ears like a physical force. The occasional snap of the campfire or distant call of a night bird only emphasized the weight of that silence, a reminder of how small their expedition was against the vastness of the wilderness.

Wei Liang's third watch position gave him a clear view of the Wastes beyond the camp's protective barrier. The landscape seemed to shift subtly in the moonlight, as if breathing. Occasionally, flashes of colored light would appear in the distance—brief illuminations that cast no shadows and revealed nothing.

He maintained his vigilance, though his thoughts kept returning to the containment vessel on his back. Its hum had grown more pronounced as they approached the Wastes, the resonance finding something within him that responded in kind. It was a connection he couldn't explain and didn't entirely trust, yet it felt significant in ways he couldn't articulate.

The third day brought them to the true boundary of the Shattered Wastes. There was no mistaking the transition—a visible line where normal reality ended and the fractured realm began. On one side, the world followed predictable rules; on the other, chaos reigned. The sky above the Wastes had a different quality of light, as if the sun itself was refracted through a prism. The ground was a patchwork of different terrains that shouldn't exist side by side—desert meeting tundra, forest growing from bare rock, pools of water suspended in midair.

Feng Zhao called a halt at the boundary. "We'll proceed in formation from here," he announced. "Inner disciples will maintain the protective barrier. Outer disciples will monitor for threats. Support staff will remain in the center of the formation."

The disciples arranged themselves as instructed, creating a moving fortress of spiritual energy. Wei Liang found himself positioned near the center, surrounded by other disciples for perhaps the first time in his life. The irony wasn't lost on him—it had taken entering one of the most dangerous places in the world to be included, however temporarily, in the group.

They crossed the boundary, and Wei Liang felt the change immediately. The air became thicker, more resistant to movement, as if they were walking through shallow water rather than open space. Sounds behaved strangely, sometimes reaching the ear before they were made, sometimes arriving with noticeable delay. Colors were more vivid, almost painfully so, with edges that seemed to bleed into one another.

The containment vessel on his back vibrated now, its hum rising to a pitch just below audibility. Wei Liang could feel it resonating with his bones, creating a strange harmony that both disturbed and fascinated him. He wondered if the others could sense it too, but no one commented on the phenomenon.

They proceeded deeper into the Wastes, following a path that existed only in the maps Elder Shen had provided to Feng Zhao. The terrain became increasingly bizarre—floating islands of earth, rivers that flowed in perfect geometric patterns, trees whose branches formed complex mathematical sequences. Beauty and horror existed side by side, often in the same object.

They passed through areas where time itself seemed damaged. In one clearing, they observed a fallen tree simultaneously rotting into soil and growing from a sapling, its entire lifecycle visible at once. In another, they walked through a zone where their movements left persistent afterimages that faded only gradually, creating a forest of ghost-selves that mimicked their actions with decreasing fidelity.

Wei Liang noticed something the others seemed to miss—in these distorted areas, his own afterimages behaved differently. While the cultivators' images glowed with spiritual energy, his own appeared as darker silhouettes, almost like negative impressions. In one particularly strong distortion field, his afterimage seemed to absorb the light around it rather than emit it.

"Curious," Liu Mei murmured, having fallen back to walk beside him. "It's as if the Wastes respond differently to those without spirit roots."

Wei Liang nodded slightly, filing away the observation. The texts he had read mentioned nothing about this phenomenon, suggesting it was either too insignificant to note or deliberately omitted from sect records.

By late afternoon, they had reached their destination—a valley where reality seemed particularly thin. The landscape here was dominated by crystalline formations that grew like plants, their surfaces reflecting light in ways that created complex, shifting patterns across the ground. At the center of the valley was a crater, perfectly circular, as if a piece of the world had been precisely excised.

Feng Zhao consulted the map one final time, then nodded with satisfaction. "This is the location. The artifact should be within the crater."

He selected three inner disciples to accompany him, instructing the others to establish a secure perimeter. "Wei Liang," he called, "bring the containment vessel. You'll wait at the crater's edge until we've secured the artifact."

Wei Liang followed as instructed, keeping a respectful distance behind the inner disciples. As they approached the crater, the vibration from the containment vessel intensified, becoming almost painful. He said nothing, enduring the discomfort in silence.

The crater's interior was unlike anything Wei Liang had ever seen. The walls were perfectly smooth, as if cut by a blade of impossible sharpness. The floor was covered in a network of lines that formed a complex array—a formation unlike any in the sect's records. The lines pulsed with faint light that shifted through colors beyond normal perception, creating afterimages that lingered in the mind rather than the eye.

From his position at the crater's edge, Wei Liang could see a pedestal at the center, upon which rested a crystalline object approximately the size of a human heart. Even at this distance, he could sense its wrongness—the way it seemed to bend light and attention around itself, the eye sliding away unless forced to focus.

As he watched, the crystalline node pulsed once, a subtle flare of energy that seemed directed... at him. A cold sensation washed over Wei Liang, as if something ancient had just taken notice of his existence. The air around him grew heavy with a presence that felt almost curious.

Wei Liang blinked, and the sensation vanished. None of the inner disciples appeared to have noticed anything unusual. He wondered if his mind was playing tricks on him—the Wastes were known to cause hallucinations and false perceptions. Yet the feeling of being observed remained, a prickling awareness at the base of his skull.

Feng Zhao and the other inner disciples descended into the crater, moving with careful precision to avoid disturbing the formation array. They followed a specific path, stepping only on certain lines while avoiding others. Wei Liang observed with interest, recognizing the technique as one used to navigate hostile formations without triggering their effects.

They reached the pedestal without incident, forming a circle around it. Feng Zhao produced a set of specialized tools from his robes—slender rods of different materials that glowed with contained spiritual energy. With these, he began to probe the crystalline node, testing its responses to different elements.

The expedition had reached its objective. All that remained was to retrieve the artifact and return to the sect. Wei Liang should have felt relief, but instead, a sense of foreboding settled over him—a premonition that their task would not be completed as easily as it appeared.

The containment vessel hummed against his back, its vibration now synchronized with the pulses of light from the formation array. Something was responding to something else, a conversation in a language Wei Liang couldn't understand but could somehow feel. And beneath it all, a sense that he was standing at the edge of a precipice, about to fall into depths he couldn't fathom.

Wei Liang kept his face carefully neutral, his posture appropriately deferential. But inside, in the hollow space where a spirit root should have been, something stirred—a resonance, an echo, a response to a call he hadn't known he was waiting to hear.
