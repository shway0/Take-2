# Chapter 1: The Rootless Disciple

The morning bell rang across the Azure Peaks Sect, a clear tone that rippled through the mountain valleys like a stone dropped in still water. Wei Liang was already awake. He had been for hours, kneeling in the corner of the outer disciples' dormitory, a cultivation manual open before him in the thin light of pre-dawn.

He closed the book with careful hands, sliding it beneath the loose floorboard where he kept his small collection of borrowed texts. Borrowed without permission, but he always returned them before they were missed from the sect library. The thought of being caught made his stomach tighten—not from fear of punishment, which was expected, but from the prospect of losing this small, secret defiance.

Wei Liang rose and straightened his gray outer disciple robes, the coarse fabric worn thin at the elbows and knees. Unlike the other disciples whose robes were replaced each season, his had been mended so many times that the original material was now more memory than substance. He ran his fingers through his hair, binding it in the simple knot that marked his station, and stepped out into the corridor.

The other outer disciples were stirring now, their movements unhurried. They had time. Wei Liang did not. He slipped past them, head slightly bowed, shoulders curved inward—the posture of someone trying to occupy as little space as possible. It was a habit formed over years, a physical manifestation of his place in the sect hierarchy.

Outside, the mountain air cut through his thin robes. The Azure Peaks lived up to their name this morning, their summits catching the first light of dawn in a blue-tinged glow that made the stone seem almost translucent. Beautiful, if one had time to look. Wei Liang kept his eyes on the path.

The kitchens were already busy when he arrived. Cook Liu, a broad-shouldered man with forearms thick as tree branches, nodded at Wei Liang's entrance.

"You're early," he said, not looking up from the vegetables he was chopping.

"Always," Wei Liang replied, moving to the large water barrels at the back of the kitchen.

He filled two wooden buckets and lifted them with practiced ease, one in each hand. The weight pulled at his shoulders, but he had been carrying water since he was seven years old. His body had adapted, even if his spirit had not.

"Inner disciples have a special training session today," Cook Liu said as Wei Liang turned to leave. "They'll need extra water brought to the east training ground by mid-morning."

Wei Liang nodded. "I'll see to it."

"And Wei Liang," Cook Liu added, his knife pausing momentarily, "Feng Zhao will be leading the session."

The name landed like a stone in Wei Liang's chest, but his expression remained neutral. "I understand."

He left the kitchen, water sloshing gently in the buckets as he made his way to the disciples' washing area. The sect was fully awake now, disciples of various ranks moving with purpose along the stone paths. They flowed around Wei Liang as if he were a rock in a stream, their eyes sliding past him without recognition.

It hadn't always been this way. When he first arrived at the sect gates, abandoned by parents who couldn't bear the shame of a rootless child, he had been visible in his novelty. The sect servants had taken him in—not out of compassion, but because even a rootless child could carry water and sweep floors. For years, he had been just another servant, until Master Jing's inexplicable decision three years ago.

Wei Liang reached the washing area and began filling the stone basins, his movements efficient and silent. The first outer disciples were arriving now, ignoring him as they prepared for the day. He kept his eyes down, but his ears open. Information was its own form of cultivation, one available even to the rootless.

"...expedition to the Shattered Wastes," one disciple was saying, his voice low with excitement. "Inner Disciple Feng is selecting the team himself."

"The Wastes?" another replied, skepticism clear in his tone. "What could be worth retrieving from that cursed place?"

"Something valuable enough that Elder Shen authorized the mission personally."

Wei Liang's hands stilled momentarily before resuming their work. The Shattered Wastes. Even he knew of that place—a fractured battlefield where reality itself had been damaged during the war of the forgotten gods. Few ventured there willingly, and fewer returned unchanged.

He finished filling the basins and collected his empty buckets, thoughts churning behind his carefully blank expression. An expedition to the Wastes would require support staff—people to carry equipment, set up camps, prepare meals. People considered expendable.

People like him.

Wei Liang made his way back to the kitchens for more water. The sun had fully risen now, illuminating the sect in golden light that did nothing to warm the chill that had settled in his core. He had survived twelve years in the Azure Peaks Sect by making himself useful while remaining unnoticed. The prospect of the Wastes threatened both conditions.

As he rounded a corner, a group of inner disciples approached from the opposite direction. Wei Liang immediately moved to the edge of the path, eyes lowered, but it wasn't enough. It never was, when Feng Zhao was involved.

"If it isn't our rootless disciple," Feng Zhao's voice carried the particular tone of amused disdain he reserved for Wei Liang. "Still carrying water? How appropriate for a void given form."

Wei Liang stopped and bowed, the proper depth for an outer disciple addressing an inner disciple. "This disciple greets Inner Disciple Feng."

Feng Zhao was everything Wei Liang was not. Tall and graceful, with the subtle glow of advanced cultivation emanating from his skin. His azure robes were immaculate, the silver trim marking him as not just an inner disciple but one of exceptional talent. His pure wood spirit root was the pride of the sect, a perfect vessel for cultivation that had allowed him to advance to the third level of Core Formation by age twenty-two.

He was also, Wei Liang knew, cruel in the casual way of those who had never faced consequences.

"I've been hearing interesting rumors about you, Wei Liang," Feng Zhao said, stepping closer. The other inner disciples formed a loose semicircle, their expressions ranging from boredom to anticipation. "They say you've been seen in the sect library after hours. Reading cultivation manuals, of all things."

Wei Liang's pulse quickened, but his face remained impassive. "This disciple was cleaning the library, as instructed."

"Of course you were." Feng Zhao's smile didn't reach his eyes. "And I'm sure you didn't understand a word of what you saw. What use is cultivation theory to the sect's forgotten shadow?"

The words were familiar barbs, ones Wei Liang had heard in various forms throughout his life. He had long ago learned that there was no correct response. Denial would be called a lie; admission would be called presumption. Silence was his only defense.

Feng Zhao stepped closer, close enough that Wei Liang could sense the faint pressure of his cultivation—a weight in the air that pushed against those without power, a subtle reminder of the natural order Feng believed in so completely. "You know, I'm assembling a team for a special mission. Perhaps I should include you."

One of the other disciples laughed. "What use would he be?"

"Every expedition needs someone to carry the bags," Feng Zhao replied, his eyes never leaving Wei Liang's face. "And if we encounter danger... well, even a rootless disciple can serve as a distraction."

The implication was clear, and a cold weight settled in Wei Liang's stomach. He had always known his value to the sect was measured primarily in his expendability, but to hear it stated so plainly still cut deep.

"This disciple serves as the sect requires," Wei Liang said, the formal words falling from his lips automatically.

"Good." Feng Zhao's smile widened. "Report to the expedition preparation hall tomorrow morning. Don't be late."

He moved past Wei Liang, deliberately bumping his shoulder hard enough that water sloshed from the buckets. The other disciples followed, several smirking as they passed. Wei Liang remained still until they were gone, then continued on his way, his wet shoes leaving dark footprints on the stone path.

Wei Liang stood motionless long after Feng Zhao and his followers had disappeared around the corner. The water in his buckets had grown still, reflecting a face he barely recognized—hollow-eyed and expressionless. A face that had learned to hide everything.

For just a moment, something cracked behind that careful mask. His hands trembled, sending ripples across the water's surface, distorting his reflection. A tightness gripped his chest, a pressure building that threatened to shatter the walls he'd built around himself. He wanted to scream, to throw the buckets against the stone path, to run until his legs gave out.

Instead, he took one careful breath. Then another. The moment passed, the walls rebuilt, the mask settled back into place. He adjusted his grip on the buckets and continued on his way, leaving only wet footprints as evidence of his momentary weakness.

The day proceeded as most days did for Wei Liang—an endless cycle of menial tasks punctuated by brief moments of stolen study. He carried water to the training grounds, watching from the periphery as disciples practiced techniques he had memorized but could never perform. He swept the corridors of the medicine hall, listening to discussions of herbs and their properties, filing away information that might someday prove useful. He served meals in the outer disciples' dining hall, collecting scraps of gossip and news.

And through it all, the knowledge of tomorrow's assignment hung over him like a sword.

As evening approached, Wei Liang completed his final tasks and made his way to the sect library. Officially, he was there to clean. Unofficially, it was the only time he could access the cultivation manuals that had become his obsession.

The library was empty at this hour, most disciples either meditating or resting. Wei Liang moved through the familiar space with quiet efficiency, the scent of ancient paper and binding glue a comfort to his senses. He dusted shelves and straightened scrolls while his eyes scanned for anything new or useful. He had already read most of the basic manuals available to outer disciples, understanding the theory even as the practice remained forever beyond his reach.

He was replacing a scroll on wood element cultivation when a soft voice broke the silence.

"You're the one who reorganized the elemental theory section, aren't you?"

Wei Liang turned, startled. A young woman stood in the doorway, her robes marking her as a core disciple—the highest rank below the elders themselves. Her presence here, alone, at this hour, was so unexpected that for a moment Wei Liang could only stare.

He recognized her, of course. Everyone in the sect knew Yun Hua, daughter of the Sect Leader, prodigy with a pure water spirit root. She was said to have reached Core Formation at sixteen, an achievement that came along perhaps once in a generation. Wei Liang had glimpsed her occasionally from a distance, but their paths had never crossed directly.

Until now.

He dropped immediately into a deep bow. "This disciple apologizes for any presumption. The scrolls were—"

"Arranged by application rather than author," she finished for him. "It's actually much more useful this way. I've been wondering who did it."

Wei Liang straightened slowly, uncertain how to respond. Yun Hua was studying him with open curiosity, her head slightly tilted. Unlike Feng Zhao's practiced arrogance, her gaze held no malice—only interest.

"You're Wei Liang," she said. It wasn't a question. "The outer disciple Master Jing elevated from the servant ranks."

"Yes, Senior Sister," he replied, using the respectful address for a higher-ranked disciple.

"And you read cultivation manuals." Again, not a question. There was no point in denying it—she had clearly already determined the truth.

"This disciple has taken the liberty of studying the theory, though he cannot practice," Wei Liang admitted, bracing for the ridicule or reprimand that usually followed such an admission.

Instead, Yun Hua nodded thoughtfully. "Theory has its own value. My water cultivation instructor says understanding precedes ability."

The statement was so unexpected that Wei Liang momentarily forgot his careful mask of deference. "The Flowing Mind Sutra says the same. 'Knowledge is the vessel that carries practice across the river of ignorance.'"

As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted them. Quoting cultivation texts to a core disciple—he might as well have claimed to be her equal. He lowered his eyes, waiting for her anger.

"You've read the Flowing Mind Sutra?" Surprise colored her voice, but not offense. "That's restricted to core disciples and above."

Wei Liang remained silent. Any explanation would only compound his transgression.

To his shock, Yun Hua laughed softly. "Don't worry. I'm not going to report you. I'm actually impressed. That text is challenging even for those with years of cultivation experience."

She studied him with new interest. "You understand it too, don't you? Not just memorizing the words."

Wei Liang hesitated, then nodded slightly. It was dangerous to admit, but something in her manner encouraged honesty.

"Interesting," she murmured. "My father says some minds are like spirit roots for knowledge—they absorb and process information in ways others cannot. Perhaps you cultivate in your own way, even without a spirit root."

The observation was dangerously close to heresy in a world where cultivation potential determined worth. Wei Liang kept his expression neutral, though her words resonated with thoughts he'd never dared voice.

She moved further into the library, her steps light and graceful. "I came here looking for information on water element applications in the Shattered Wastes. My father mentioned an expedition is being prepared."

Wei Liang's surprise must have shown on his face, because she added, "You know of it?"

"This disciple has been assigned to the expedition," he said carefully. "As support staff."

Something flickered across Yun Hua's expression—concern, perhaps. "The Wastes are dangerous, even for advanced cultivators. The reality distortions affect everyone, regardless of cultivation level."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. He knew the risks, probably better than most of those who would be going. He had read every account of the Wastes available in the sect library, memorizing the descriptions of reality fissures, corrupted spiritual energy, and the strange entities that dwelled there.

"This disciple will be careful," he said, the words hollow even to his own ears. Caution meant little when one was considered expendable.

Yun Hua seemed about to say something more when footsteps sounded in the corridor outside. Her expression changed, becoming more distant.

"I should go," she said, turning toward the door. "Thank you for your assistance with the library organization."

She paused at the threshold, looking back at him. "Wei Liang... the eastern section of the Wastes is particularly unstable. The water flows backward there, and memories can manifest physically. Remember that."

Before he could respond, she was gone, leaving Wei Liang alone with the dust motes dancing in the fading light and the strange, unexpected warmth of having been seen—truly seen—for perhaps the first time in his life.

The warmth didn't last. As darkness fell and Wei Liang made his way back to the outer disciples' dormitory, reality reasserted itself. Tomorrow he would join an expedition to one of the most dangerous places in the world, led by someone who viewed him as less than human. His chances of return were slim at best.

In the dormitory, the other disciples were already settling onto their sleeping mats. No one acknowledged Wei Liang's entrance. He made his way to his corner, the smallest space with the thinnest mat, and sat cross-legged. Sleep would not come easily tonight.

Instead, he closed his eyes and began the breathing exercises he had read about in countless cultivation manuals. He could not circulate spiritual energy—he had no spirit root to gather it—but the techniques still calmed his mind and strengthened his body in small ways.

As his breathing slowed, Wei Liang allowed himself to imagine, just for a moment, what it might be like to have been born different. To have a spirit root, to feel the world's energy responding to his call, to be valued for his potential rather than his utility.

A memory surfaced—three years ago, when he had first arrived at the sect. An elder had tested all the new arrivals for spirit roots, moving from child to child with a glowing crystal. When the elder reached Wei Liang, the crystal had dimmed completely. The elder had frowned, tested again, then set the crystal aside.

"Perhaps," the elder had said quietly, almost to himself, "there might be another way..."

But then another elder had called out, demanding attention for a child whose crystal had flared with exceptional brightness. The moment had passed, the possibility forgotten by everyone except Wei Liang, who had clung to those three words for years. Perhaps there might be another way. No one had ever bothered to look for it.

The fantasy was a dangerous indulgence, one he rarely permitted himself. Tonight, with the Shattered Wastes looming in his future, he granted himself this small mercy.

In the darkness behind his closed eyes, Wei Liang pictured spiritual energy flowing through meridians he had memorized but never felt. He imagined the sensation of a core forming within his dantian, the power building with each breath. He visualized techniques he had studied but could never perform—the Verdant Sword Art that Feng Zhao wielded, the Flowing Water Steps that Yun Hua must know.

Reality would return with the morning bell. For now, in the privacy of his mind, Wei Liang allowed himself to cultivate the only thing truly his own—his dreams.

Outside, the moon rose over the Azure Peaks, bathing the sect in silver light that transformed the mundane into the mystical. Inside, a rootless disciple breathed in patterns that should have been meaningless to him, unaware that far away in the Shattered Wastes, something ancient stirred in response to his silent defiance.

Something that had been waiting for a vessel empty enough to receive it.

Unaware, too, that in a secluded chamber high in the sect's inner peaks, Elder Shen paused in her meditation, a frown crossing her weathered face. For years, she had sensed something unusual about the rootless boy—a peculiar emptiness that wasn't quite natural. She had watched him from afar, noting his hunger for knowledge, his resilience, his careful navigation of a world designed to break him.

"Too dangerous to test," she murmured to herself, returning to her meditation. "Better to let sleeping dragons lie."

But dragons, once awakened, rarely return to slumber.
