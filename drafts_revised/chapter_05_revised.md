# Chapter 5: Hollowborn

The Shattered Wastes stretched before Wei Liang, a fractured landscape of impossible geometries and corrupted reality. He stood at the edge of a valley, observing the terrain with his newly enhanced perception. Colors appeared more vivid, details sharper, as if he now saw the world through a lens that revealed what had always been hidden.

The hole in his chest remained, a perfect circle extending completely through his torso. It no longer disturbed him—indeed, it felt right somehow, a physical manifestation of the emptiness that had always defined him. Now that emptiness had purpose, direction, potential.

Wei Liang extended his awareness, feeling the currents of spiritual energy that flowed through the valley. The energy manifested not just as visible streams but as complex harmonies that vibrated against his consciousness—discordant notes that somehow formed a coherent melody. Each type of energy carried its own signature: wood essence hummed with life and growth, water essence flowed in liquid tones, while corrupted energy rasped like metal against stone.

Unlike traditional cultivators who gathered and refined this energy, he sensed it as something to be consumed—fuel for the emptiness within him.

He reached out with his new senses and touched a nearby stream. The water was cool against his skin—he could perceive its temperature with perfect precision, could describe the exact degree of its chill, could even recall how such coolness would have felt before his transformation. But the sensation itself was hollow, a technical observation rather than an experience.

He remembered sitting by a stream near the sect during rare moments of rest, how the cool water had once brought relief on hot days, how it had felt alive against his skin. Now he perceived the water's properties without truly feeling them. The memory of comfort remained, but the experience itself was beyond his reach.

A small sacrifice, he told himself, for power. Yet the thought rang false, even to his own mind. Not small at all, but the first of many costs he would pay along this path.

The Hollow Woman materialized beside him, her darkness flowing like liquid. The air around her carried a strange absence—not just of light but of sound, as if her presence created a pocket of perfect silence. When she moved, reality seemed to bend slightly, creating a visual distortion like heat rising from summer stone.

"You are adapting quickly," she observed. "Most new Hollowborn struggle more with the transition."

"I had less to lose," Wei Liang replied. "No cultivation base to be disrupted, no spiritual pathways to be rewritten."

"True. Your emptiness was already well-developed." She gestured toward the valley below. "What do you sense there?"

Wei Liang focused his awareness, extending it like invisible tendrils into the space before him. "Corrupted spiritual energy, primarily. Some natural formations that have been twisted by the Wastes' influence. A few small creatures, also corrupted."

"And beyond that?"

He pushed his awareness further, straining against unfamiliar limitations. "Something... larger. More structured. Artificial."

"Good." The Hollow Woman's form rippled with what might have been approval. "A remnant from before the cataclysm—a pavilion similar to the one where we met, but less well-preserved. It contains knowledge that may be useful to you."

"Why not simply tell me what I need to know?" Wei Liang asked.

"The Forgotten Path cannot be taught solely through instruction," she replied. "It must be experienced, discovered, internalized. I can guide you, but much of your learning will come through direct interaction with the remnants of those who walked this path before."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting this approach. It wasn't so different from how he had learned in the sect—stealing knowledge piece by piece, assembling understanding from fragments never intended for him.

"There is another reason," the Hollow Woman added. "The pavilion is currently occupied by a corrupted entity—one with significant spiritual energy. You need to feed."

The hunger stirred within Wei Liang at these words, a void-deep craving that pulsed in time with his awareness. He had been ignoring it, focusing on exploration and discovery rather than consumption. But the emptiness was growing, demanding to be filled.

"What kind of entity?" he asked, his voice steady despite the hunger's pull.

"Once a cultivator, now something else. The Wastes change those who remain too long, especially those who lack proper protection. This one has been here for decades, gradually transforming into a creature of corruption."

Wei Liang considered this information. "Is it sentient? Aware?"

"Does that matter?" the Hollow Woman countered. "It exists. It possesses energy you need. The Forgotten Path does not concern itself with conventional morality."

In his previous life, he had clung to whatever scraps of morality he could afford—small kindnesses, minor principles that separated him from true monsters. Now—when he was merely the sect's forgotten shadow—he had clung to whatever scraps of morality he could afford, small kindnesses that proved he was more than the nothing they named him.

But he had died. What returned was something else—something that hungered, something that needed to consume to survive and grow.

"Show me how," he said finally.

The Hollow Woman's darkness flowed around him, not quite touching but close enough that he could feel the absence she embodied—a void deeper and more refined than his own.

"The basic technique is simple," she explained. "Where conventional cultivators project spiritual energy outward, you will create channels of emptiness that draw energy inward. The void at your core will do most of the work—you need only direct it."

She guided him through a series of mental exercises, teaching him to extend his emptiness beyond his physical form. It was like learning to move a limb he hadn't known he possessed—awkward at first, then increasingly natural as he practiced.

"Remember," she cautioned, "consumption without purpose is mere appetite. You must maintain your intention throughout the process. What are you becoming with this act?"

Wei Liang focused on the question, finding his answer in the memories that remained from his former life. "I am becoming justice," he said. "I am becoming recognition. I am becoming what the Azure Peaks Sect feared most—proof that their understanding of cultivation is incomplete."

"Good. Hold that intention as you feed. It will shape what you gain from the consumption."

They descended into the valley, moving through the corrupted landscape with careful precision. Wei Liang found that the Wastes responded differently to him now—reality distortions that would have harmed a normal cultivator simply flowed around him, recognizing in him a kindred brokenness.

As Wei Liang moved through the corrupted landscape, he noticed something curious—the environment seemed to respond to his presence. Areas of instability calmed as he passed, as if recognizing something kindred in his fractured nature.

The realization was unsettling. The Wastes were broken reality, the result of catastrophic damage to the world's fundamental principles. If these shattered places recognized him as similar, what did that say about what he was becoming?

He paused at the edge of a reality fissure—a place where the world had cracked open, revealing the void beneath. Looking into it was like looking into a mirror. The emptiness gazed back, familiar and welcoming. Just as the Wastes had been transformed by forces beyond comprehension, so too had he been remade by powers he was only beginning to understand.

The parallel was both disturbing and comforting. Perhaps this was why he could survive here when others could not—he and the Wastes were reflections of each other, both hollowed out and refilled with something that should not exist.

They reached the pavilion by midday—or what passed for midday in the perpetual twilight of the Wastes. Unlike the well-preserved structure where Wei Liang had first met the Hollow Woman, this pavilion showed clear signs of decay. Its walls were cracked, its roof partially collapsed, its foundation sinking into the corrupted soil beneath.

Yet it still stood, protected by remnants of once-powerful formation arrays. Wei Liang could see the patterns etched into its structure, faded but functional, maintaining a pocket of relative stability in the chaos of the Wastes.

"The entity is inside," the Hollow Woman said, her voice dropping to a whisper that seemed to absorb sound rather than create it. "Extend your awareness. Feel its energy."

Wei Liang complied, sending tendrils of emptiness toward the pavilion. He encountered resistance immediately—a barrier of corrupted spiritual energy that pushed back against his probing. Beyond it, he sensed a presence—something large and powerful, its energy a twisted knot of what had once been a cultivation base but was now something else entirely.

"I feel it," he confirmed. "Its energy is... wrong. Distorted."

"Corruption changes spiritual energy, just as it changes physical form," the Hollow Woman explained. "But the essence remains useful. For practitioners of the Forgotten Path, corrupted energy is sometimes easier to consume than pure cultivation—it has already been partially broken down."

Wei Liang studied the entity's spiritual signature more carefully. It had once been a cultivator of considerable power—perhaps at the Core Formation stage or beyond. Now that power had been twisted, its original elemental affinity lost beneath layers of corruption.

"How do I approach it?" he asked.

"Directly," the Hollow Woman replied. "Your current form is still mostly physical. You cannot yet phase through barriers or conceal your presence completely. But you can use the hunger to your advantage."

She flowed closer, her darkness enveloping him like a cloak. "The entity will sense your emptiness and be drawn to it. Corruption seeks to spread, to fill voids. It will perceive you as a potential vessel for expansion."

"And when it approaches?"

"You reverse the dynamic. Instead of allowing it to fill you, you consume it."

The strategy was simple enough in concept, though Wei Liang suspected the execution would prove more challenging. Still, the hunger urged him forward, eager for the spiritual energy it had been promised.

He approached the pavilion alone, the Hollow Woman remaining at a distance to observe but not intervene. As he neared the entrance, the resistance increased—the barrier of corrupted energy pushing against him like a physical force. He pushed back with his own emptiness, creating a channel through the barrier rather than attempting to break it.

The entity within stirred, sensing his presence. Wei Liang felt its attention focus on him—a predatory awareness that evaluated him as potential prey. It moved toward the entrance, drawn by the emptiness it sensed.

What emerged from the pavilion defied easy description. It had once been human, but corruption had reshaped it into something monstrous. Its body was elongated and asymmetrical, with additional limbs sprouting at odd angles. Its skin had the texture of bark but the color of bruised flesh. Where its face should have been, there was only a swirling vortex of corrupted spiritual energy.

It paused at the threshold, studying Wei Liang with senses that had nothing to do with conventional sight. Then it spoke, its voice a discordant harmony of multiple tones.

"Empty," it said, the word somehow conveying both hunger and fascination. "So empty. Need filling."

Wei Liang stood his ground, allowing his emptiness to become more pronounced—a void that called to the entity's corrupted nature. "Yes," he agreed. "Empty."

The entity moved forward, extending a misshapen limb toward the hole in Wei Liang's chest. Corrupted energy flowed from it like smoke, reaching for the emptiness it sensed.

This was the moment the Hollow Woman had prepared him for. As the corruption touched his void, Wei Liang reversed the flow—not allowing it to enter, but drawing it in on his terms. He extended channels of emptiness into the entity's form, creating pathways for its energy to flow into his core.

The entity reacted with immediate alarm, trying to withdraw. But Wei Liang had established the connection, and the hunger within him surged forward, eager for consumption. He maintained his intention throughout—justice, recognition, proof—shaping the process according to his will rather than surrendering to mere appetite.

The corrupted energy flowed into him, filling the emptiness without diminishing it—a paradox that made perfect sense within the inverted logic of the Forgotten Path. As he consumed, Wei Liang gained not just power but knowledge—fragments of the entity's memories, techniques it had known in its former life, experiences it had accumulated during its long existence in the Wastes.

The entity struggled, its form beginning to collapse as its energy was drained. It lashed out with its remaining limbs, but Wei Liang easily avoided the increasingly weak attacks. The consumption accelerated, the hunger growing more efficient as it fed.

Finally, the entity collapsed entirely, its physical form dissolving into motes of corrupted energy that Wei Liang absorbed with a single inhalation. Where it had stood, only a small pile of crystalline dust remained—the physical components that could not be converted to energy.

Wei Liang stood motionless, processing what he had gained. The entity had once been a cultivator from a sect he didn't recognize, perhaps from before the cataclysm. It had possessed knowledge of formation arrays specialized for reality manipulation—techniques that had been lost in the modern era. Most importantly, it had known of the Forgotten Path, had sought it deliberately after its corruption began, hoping to find a way to reverse the process.

It had failed, of course. The Forgotten Path did not restore; it transformed. But its knowledge would serve Wei Liang well.

The Hollow Woman approached, her darkness flowing around the crystalline dust without disturbing it. "Well done," she said. "A clean consumption. You maintained your intention throughout."

Wei Liang nodded, still integrating the knowledge he had gained. "It knew of the Forgotten Path. It came here seeking it."

"Many do, when conventional methods fail them. Few find what they seek. Fewer still survive the finding." She gestured toward the pavilion. "Now you may enter. The knowledge within will make more sense to you after this consumption."

Wei Liang entered the damaged structure, finding its interior in better condition than its exterior had suggested. The walls were covered in inscriptions similar to those in the first pavilion, though these focused on different aspects of the Forgotten Path.

Where the first pavilion had described the stages of advancement, this one detailed specific techniques for consumption and integration. It explained how different types of spiritual energy could be absorbed, how the knowledge and abilities of consumed cultivators could be selectively retained, and how to manage the growing hunger that accompanied advancement along the path.

"The Forgotten Path consumes. It breaks. It unmakes. The traditional paths build and refine—they create stability. We..." She paused. "We create change through destruction. Few civilizations welcome such force within their borders."

Wei Liang absorbed this, finding no argument against her assessment. The hunger within him didn't care for stability or civilization—it wanted only to consume, to grow stronger through the absorption of others' power.

"There is another cost," the Hollow Woman added, her darkness shifting. "Memory becomes currency on this path. Each advancement requires sacrifice—not just of spiritual energy, but of self."

"I've already lost memories," Wei Liang acknowledged.

"Those were taken from you," she corrected. "Different from what lies ahead. To progress beyond the Hollow stage, you must choose which memories to surrender. The most precious ones fuel the greatest transformations."

Wei Liang considered this. "Why would anyone willingly walk such a path?"

"Those who have nothing left to lose," she replied. "Those betrayed so completely that forgetting becomes mercy. Those who value power over selfhood." Her form rippled. "Or those who never had a place in the cultivation world to begin with."

The words struck uncomfortably close to Wei Liang's core. He had been defined by absence his entire life—absence of spirit root, absence of value, absence of belonging. Perhaps it was fitting that his path to power came through embracing that emptiness rather than denying it.

He studied the inscriptions more carefully, focusing on the techniques for consumption. According to the text, there were multiple methods, each suited to different types of targets. Corrupted entities like the one he had just consumed were the simplest—their energy already partially broken down, their resistance minimal. Cultivators would be more challenging, their structured spiritual energy requiring more sophisticated techniques to absorb.

The most difficult targets would be those with exceptional cultivation bases—Core Formation or beyond. Such individuals possessed not just powerful spiritual energy but highly developed spiritual sense, making them capable of detecting and countering consumption attempts. For these targets, the inscriptions described techniques of ambush and misdirection, ways to establish consumption channels before the target became aware of the danger.

Wei Liang thought of Feng Zhao, imagining how the inner disciple's face would change as he realized his spiritual energy was being drained away. The image brought a cold satisfaction that was immediately followed by concern—not for Feng Zhao, but for himself. The ease with which he contemplated such actions suggested the Forgotten Path was already changing him in ways beyond the physical.

"You're learning quickly," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing beside him as he studied the inscriptions. "Most new Hollowborn take much longer to grasp these concepts."

"I've spent my life studying cultivation techniques I could never use," Wei Liang replied. "The principles are not entirely unfamiliar, merely inverted."

"True. Your background gives you advantages others lack." She paused, her form settling into stillness. "But remember—understanding is not the same as mastery. You will need practice before attempting to consume a true cultivator."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting the wisdom of this approach. The hunger within him was temporarily sated by the corrupted entity, but he knew it would return, stronger than before. When it did, he would need targets—preferably ones that posed minimal risk while he refined his techniques.

"There are other corrupted entities in the Wastes," the Hollow Woman continued, as if reading his thoughts. "Some were once cultivators, like the one you consumed. Others were beasts or plants transformed by exposure to the corruption. All can serve as practice for your developing skills."

"And after I've mastered those targets?" Wei Liang asked.

"Then we find you cultivators. The Wastes attract many—explorers, treasure hunters, sect disciples on training missions. Most are unprepared for what they encounter. They will make suitable prey as you advance toward the Fracture stage."

The term caught Wei Liang's attention. "Fracture stage?"

"The second stage of the Forgotten Path. Where Hollowborn represents the initial transformation and awakening of the void, Fracture marks the beginning of true power—the point where your emptiness begins to extend beyond your physical form, creating cracks in reality itself through which you can project your will."

Wei Liang considered this description, finding in it echoes of what he had glimpsed in the void between death and rebirth. "How will I know when I'm ready to advance?"

"The hunger will tell you," she replied. "When it can no longer be satisfied by corrupted entities or minor cultivators, when it demands more substantial prey—then you will be approaching the threshold of Fracture."

They spent the remainder of the day in the pavilion, with the Hollow Woman guiding Wei Liang through the inscriptions, explaining concepts that weren't immediately clear and demonstrating certain techniques through her own mastery of void manipulation. By evening—or what passed for evening in the Wastes' perpetual twilight—Wei Liang had absorbed the pavilion's knowledge as completely as he had absorbed the corrupted entity's energy.

As they prepared to leave, Wei Liang paused at the threshold, looking back at the damaged structure. "There are more of these pavilions?"

"Many," the Hollow Woman confirmed. "They were created by early practitioners of the Forgotten Path, repositories of knowledge hidden throughout the world. Most have been destroyed by sects or natural disasters, but those in the Wastes remain relatively intact, protected by the very corruption that keeps others away."

"And you know where they are?"

"Some. Others we will discover together." Her darkness flowed past him, out into the corrupted landscape. "The path ahead is long, Wei Liang. The Hollowborn stage typically lasts years, sometimes decades. Do not rush your advancement—each stage must be fully mastered before progression is attempted."

Wei Liang followed her into the Wastes, his newly enhanced senses alert for both dangers and opportunities. The hunger within him had settled into a quiet presence, temporarily satisfied but always aware, always waiting for its next meal.

As they traveled, the Hollow Woman shared more of her knowledge—not just techniques of the Forgotten Path, but information about the Wastes themselves. She explained how the corruption flowed in currents, how reality distortions followed patterns that could be predicted and navigated, how certain areas remained more stable than others due to remnant formation arrays from before the cataclysm.

"The Wastes are not merely damaged reality," she told him. "They are reality in flux, constantly rewriting itself according to principles we only partially understand. In many ways, they are the perfect environment for practitioners of the Forgotten Path—a place where conventional rules have already been broken, where emptiness and consumption are part of the natural order."

Wei Liang absorbed this perspective, finding in it a strange comfort. Perhaps this was why he felt more at home in the Wastes than he ever had in the Azure Peaks Sect—here, his fundamental nature was not an aberration but an adaptation, not a flaw but an advantage.

They established a base in another pavilion, this one smaller but better preserved than the previous two. It stood in a valley where a stream flowed in a perfect spiral pattern, creating a formation that naturally stabilized the surrounding area. Within this relative safety, Wei Liang began his formal training in the Forgotten Path.

Days blended into weeks as he practiced the techniques he had learned, refining his control over the emptiness within him. He learned to extend his void awareness with greater precision, to create more efficient consumption channels, to selectively absorb specific aspects of the energy he consumed. The Hollow Woman was a demanding teacher, accepting nothing less than perfect execution of each technique before allowing him to progress to the next.

Between training sessions, they hunted corrupted entities throughout the nearby regions of the Wastes. Each consumption added to Wei Liang's power and knowledge, gradually expanding his capabilities while teaching him to manage the growing hunger. He developed preferences—certain types of corrupted energy tasted better, provided more useful knowledge, or integrated more smoothly with his developing abilities.

Throughout this period, Wei Liang maintained his core intention—justice, recognition, proof. It shaped his consumption, focusing the power he gained toward specific ends rather than general advancement. The Hollow Woman approved of this discipline, noting that many practitioners of the Forgotten Path lost themselves to hunger precisely because they lacked such focus.

"The void consumes indiscriminately," she explained during one training session. "Without direction from your will, it will absorb everything it touches, including parts of yourself you might wish to preserve. Your intention acts as a filter, determining what is kept and what is discarded."

Wei Liang nodded, understanding the principle both intellectually and intuitively. He had noticed that his consumption yielded different results depending on his mental state—when his focus on vengeance was strongest, he gained more combat-oriented abilities; when he concentrated on proving the incompleteness of conventional cultivation theory, he absorbed more theoretical knowledge.

"Is that why memory becomes currency?" he asked. "Because the void would consume it otherwise?"

"Partly," the Hollow Woman replied. "But there is more to it. The Forgotten Path inverts conventional cultivation in all aspects. Where traditional paths build upon the foundation of who you are, the Forgotten Path requires you to gradually surrender your identity. Each stage of advancement demands the sacrifice of something that defines you."

Wei Liang considered this requirement. "What did you sacrifice?"

The Hollow Woman's darkness rippled, suggesting what might have been discomfort. "My name. My origin. My purpose before the Path. All gone, surrendered to reach the Dissolution stage."

"And was it worth it?"

"Worth implies values, preferences, desires—concepts that have little meaning to one at my stage of advancement." Her form shifted, flowing like liquid shadow. "I exist. I persist. I guide those who follow. That is sufficient."

The answer was both enlightening and disturbing. It suggested that the endpoint of the Forgotten Path was not merely power but transformation so complete that conventional human concerns ceased to matter. Wei Liang wondered if that was truly what he wanted—to become something so alien that vengeance and recognition lost all meaning.

But such philosophical concerns were secondary to his immediate goals. He needed power—power to survive, power to return to the Azure Peaks Sect, power to show Feng Zhao and the others exactly what their actions had created. The long-term consequences could be addressed later, assuming he lived long enough for them to matter.

As weeks became months, Wei Liang's progress accelerated. The hole in his chest remained, but it no longer seemed like a wound—instead, it had become a visible manifestation of his cultivation, a window into the void that was his core. He learned to use it actively, channeling consumption through it for more efficient absorption of spiritual energy.

His physical appearance changed subtly as well. His skin grew paler, almost translucent in certain lights, revealing hints of the emptiness that flowed beneath the surface. His eyes darkened, the pupils expanding until only a thin ring of iris remained. His movements became more fluid, less bound by conventional physics, as if the connection between his will and his form had grown more direct.

The Hollow Woman noted these changes with approval. "You are fully embracing the Hollowborn stage," she observed. "Soon you will be ready for more challenging prey."

That opportunity came sooner than expected. During one of their hunting expeditions, Wei Liang's enhanced senses detected something unusual—spiritual energy signatures that didn't belong to corrupted entities. Cultivators had entered the Wastes, their presence a bright beacon to his void awareness.

"White Lotus hunters," the Hollow Woman identified them after extending her own senses. "Cultivators who specialize in eliminating corruption threats. They patrol the boundaries of the Wastes, venturing deeper only when they detect significant disturbances."

"Are they hunting us?" Wei Liang asked, concerned that his consumption activities might have drawn attention.

"Not specifically. The Wastes generate many anomalies that trigger their detection methods. But they are dangerous—Core Formation cultivators with specialized techniques for combating corruption."

Wei Liang considered this information. "Should we avoid them?"

The Hollow Woman's form shifted thoughtfully. "They would be challenging prey at your current stage. But observing them could be valuable. Their techniques for detecting corruption might help you learn to conceal your nature more effectively."

They approached cautiously, maintaining enough distance to observe without being detected. The White Lotus hunters were a group of five cultivators, all wearing the distinctive white robes with lotus emblems that gave their order its name. They moved with disciplined precision through the corrupted landscape, their spiritual energy forming a protective formation that repelled the Wastes' influence.

Wei Liang studied their techniques with interest. Unlike the Azure Peaks expedition, which had relied on brute spiritual power to maintain their barrier, the White Lotus hunters used more sophisticated methods—formations that adapted to specific types of corruption, techniques that neutralized reality distortions rather than simply blocking them, movements that minimized their spiritual energy signature while maximizing their detection range.

"They're well-trained," he observed quietly.

"They've fought corruption for centuries," the Hollow Woman replied. "Since long before the cataclysm that created the Wastes. In the early days, they hunted practitioners of the Forgotten Path, viewing us as a form of corruption in the cultivation world."

Wei Liang absorbed this historical context, understanding why such hunters would be particularly dangerous to him. "Can they detect me specifically? Distinguish between natural corruption and the Forgotten Path?"

"At close range, yes. Your emptiness has a different quality than typical corruption—more structured, more purposeful. An experienced hunter would recognize the difference immediately."

This was valuable information. If Wei Liang intended to eventually return to the cultivation world, he would need to develop methods to conceal his nature from such specialized detection.

They observed the White Lotus hunters for several hours as they methodically searched an area where reality distortions were particularly strong. Eventually, the hunters located what they sought—a corruption node, a crystalline formation that actively spread corruption to its surroundings.

Wei Liang watched with fascination as they deployed specialized tools and techniques to neutralize the node. Rather than destroying it directly, they established a containment formation, gradually reducing its influence until it could be safely extracted and stored in a specialized vessel.

"They're preserving it," he noted with surprise.

"The White Lotus order studies corruption as well as combats it," the Hollow Woman explained. "They believe understanding is necessary for effective opposition. Some of their most powerful techniques were developed by analyzing the very forces they seek to eliminate."

The irony wasn't lost on Wei Liang. These hunters, dedicated to fighting corruption, used methods that paralleled his own in certain ways—consumption of a different sort, transformation of a different kind.

As the White Lotus hunters completed their task and prepared to depart, Wei Liang felt the hunger stir within him. Their spiritual energy was rich and refined, far more potent than the corrupted entities he had been consuming. The void at his core responded to their presence, urging him to attack, to feed, to grow stronger.

He resisted the impulse, knowing he wasn't yet ready for such challenging prey. But the hunger had tasted possibility now, and it would not easily forget. Sooner or later, he would need to test himself against true cultivators.

The Hollow Woman sensed his struggle. "The hunger grows," she observed. "That is good. It means you are approaching the threshold of advancement. But patience remains essential. Consuming before you are ready would likely result in your destruction."

Wei Liang nodded, forcing the hunger back into quiescence through the techniques she had taught him. "When will I be ready?"

"Soon," she promised. "There are weaker cultivators who enter the Wastes—scavengers who collect corrupted materials to sell to sects. They operate in the boundary regions where corruption is mild enough to permit extended stays without protection. They would make suitable first prey for your transition to consuming true cultivation bases."

The prospect both excited and disturbed Wei Liang. Consuming corrupted entities was one thing—they were already lost, already transformed into something other than their original nature. Consuming cultivators would be different—a deliberate taking of life, a crossing of a moral boundary he had not yet breached.

But the hunger cared nothing for such distinctions. It wanted only to grow, to consume, to transform him into something beyond his current limitations. And part of him—the part that remembered Feng Zhao's sword piercing his heart, that recalled years of casual cruelty and dismissal—welcomed that transformation.

As they returned to their base, Wei Liang reflected on how far he had come since his death and rebirth. From a rootless disciple valued only for his expendability, he had become a practitioner of an ancient and forbidden path, capable of feats that would astonish the very sect that had discarded him.

Yet he had only begun his journey. The Hollowborn stage was merely the first step on the Forgotten Path. Ahead lay Fracture, Consumption, Dissolution, and finally Ascension—each stage representing a transformation more profound than the last, each requiring sacrifices he could only begin to imagine.

The void within him pulsed with anticipation, hungry for what was to come.
