# Chapter 4: The Void Between

Darkness.

Not the absence of light, but the absence of everything—sight, sound, sensation, self. A void so complete that it defied comprehension.

Then, slowly, awareness returned. Not physical awareness—Wei Liang had no body to feel, no eyes to see, no ears to hear. But consciousness persisted, a spark floating in infinite emptiness.

*Am I dead?* The thought formed without words, a concept rather than language.

*Not yet.* The response came from everywhere and nowhere, not a voice but an impression directly upon his consciousness.

*What is this place?*

*The space between. The void that connects all things. The emptiness from which reality is formed.*

Wei Liang's consciousness drifted in this non-place, trying to make sense of his situation. The last thing he remembered was Feng Zhao's sword piercing his heart, the cold spread of death through his limbs, the strange expansion of the emptiness within him.

*Why am I here?*

*Because you were empty enough to receive us.*

*Us?*

No direct answer came. Instead, memories began to surface—not his own, but fragments from other lives, other times. He witnessed the construction of the formation array in the crater, saw hands that weren't his placing the crystalline node upon its pedestal. He experienced the cataclysm that had created the Shattered Wastes, felt reality itself tear under the strain of powers beyond mortal comprehension.

More memories followed, flowing faster now. The rise and fall of cultivation sects, the development of techniques to harness spiritual energy, the endless cycle of discovery and loss as knowledge passed from one generation to the next. Through it all, a constant theme—the search for ascension, for transcendence, for escape from the limitations of mortal existence.

And beneath these memories, a darker current—the shadow paths, the inverse methods, the techniques deemed too dangerous or corrupting to be preserved. Among these, the Forgotten Path—a method of cultivation that consumed rather than built, that emptied rather than filled, that broke rather than forged.

The memories began to fragment, breaking apart like the shattered containment vessel. Pieces disappeared, leaving gaps in the narrative of his life. Wei Liang tried to hold onto them, suddenly desperate not to lose these parts of himself, but they slipped away like water through cupped hands.

*No,* he thought, reaching for a fading image of his first day in the sect. *Don't take that. It's mine.*

A memory surfaced—his tenth year at the sect, a winter festival where lanterns filled the night sky. He had been assigned to clean the courtyard afterward, alone in the cold as everyone else celebrated inside. A young outer disciple had approached, offering a steamed bun still warm from the kitchen.

"No one should be hungry during the festival," she had said simply, before hurrying away.

He never learned her name. The next day, she treated him with the same distant politeness as everyone else. But that small kindness—that moment of being seen as human rather than tool—had sustained him through weeks of winter chill.

Now even this memory was dissolving, the girl's face blurring, the warmth of the bun fading from his phantom hands.

"Please," he whispered into the void, his composure finally breaking. "Not this one."

But the void was merciless, and the memory vanished like all the others, leaving only the knowledge that something precious had been lost.

*What use are such things to one who walks the Forgotten Path?* the voice that wasn't a voice returned, resonating through the dissolving memories.

*I never chose this path.*

*Choice is an illusion cultivators tell themselves to feel in control. You were born empty. The Path was always yours.*

More memories surfaced, but these were different—not experiences but knowledge, techniques and methods for a form of cultivation unlike any taught in the Azure Peaks Sect. Wei Liang absorbed them without understanding, information flooding into the emptiness where his spirit root should have been.

He learned that conventional cultivation gathered and refined spiritual energy, building a foundation that eventually allowed transcendence. The Forgotten Path inverted this process—it consumed spiritual energy from external sources, using it to expand and strengthen the internal void. Where traditional cultivators sought to fill themselves with power, practitioners of the Forgotten Path became vessels of ever-increasing emptiness.

*Why show me this?*

*Because you are suitable. Because you survived what should have killed you. Because the node recognized in you a kindred emptiness.*

The darkness receded. He found himself in a new location—not a memory this time, but somewhere he had never been.

A vast chamber stretched around him, its walls, floor, and ceiling formed from the same crystalline material as the node from the array. The space pulsed with energy that flowed in visible currents, like rivers of light streaming through the air. At the center stood a formation array far more complex than the one they had found in the Wastes—a perfect circle of pillars surrounding a raised platform.

Upon the platform stood figures that defied description. They were humanoid in basic shape, but their forms shifted constantly, as if reality itself couldn't decide on their appearance. They moved with purpose, manipulating the energy currents, shaping them into patterns that hurt Wei Liang's mind to observe.

*The forgotten gods,* he realized with sudden certainty. *Before the cataclysm. Before they were forgotten.*

One of the figures paused in its work, turning toward Wei Liang as if sensing his presence across the vast gulf of time. Its face—if it could be called a face—seemed to focus, features resolving momentarily into something almost human.

It spoke, and though Wei Liang couldn't hear the words, he felt their meaning imprint directly upon his consciousness:

*We created the paths to ascension, the methods by which lesser beings might approach our state. But for every path forged, a shadow path forms—an inverse, a reflection. We hid these shadow paths, for they lead to power through destruction rather than creation.*

The figure's form began to blur again, its momentary clarity fading.

*The Forgotten Path is one such shadow. It consumes rather than builds. It empties rather than fills. It breaks rather than forges. And yet, in breaking, it creates something new—something that should not be.*

The vision dissolved, the crystalline chamber breaking apart into fragments that swirled around Wei Liang like a storm, then struck him all at once. There was no pain—his body wasn't really here, after all—but he felt each entry as a cold shock, like plunging into winter water. The shards didn't stop at his skin but continued inward, replacing blood and bone and tissue with their crystalline substance.

For a moment, he was aware of himself as something inhuman—a crystalline statue in the shape of a man, hollow inside, waiting to be filled.

Then even that awareness shattered.

Wei Liang opened eyes he hadn't expected to possess again. He lay on his back, staring up at a sky that couldn't exist—a swirling maelstrom of colors that defied description, punctuated by floating islands of solid matter. The Shattered Wastes, but seen from a perspective he hadn't experienced before.

He sat up slowly, expecting pain from the sword wound. There was none. He looked down at his chest, where Feng Zhao's blade had pierced his heart. A hole remained, perfectly circular, extending completely through his torso. Yet he lived. He breathed. He thought.

*How is this possible?*

He probed the wound with cautious fingers, finding the edges smooth and cold, like polished stone. No blood flowed. No organs pulsed within. The hole was simply... empty. A void that passed through him without affecting his function.

Wei Liang stood, testing his new body. It moved as he commanded, though with a strange lightness that suggested fundamental changes to its composition. He felt both more and less substantial—as if parts of him had become more real while others had faded toward nonexistence.

He examined his surroundings. He was still near the expedition's camp, though at some distance from where he had fallen. The protective barrier glowed faintly in the chaotic darkness, a thin shell of order in the midst of the Wastes. Within it, he could see figures moving—the disciples preparing to continue their journey, unaware that their discarded tool had somehow survived.

Wei Liang considered approaching them, confronting Feng Zhao with his failure. The thought brought a cold satisfaction that was immediately followed by something deeper and more dangerous—hunger. Not physical hunger, but a void-deep craving for something he had never before desired.

Spiritual energy. Cultivation. Power.

He could sense it now, flowing through the disciples within the barrier. Each was a reservoir of refined energy, some larger than others, all tantalizingly accessible to his new awareness. He could feel how that energy might be drawn out, consumed, used to expand the emptiness within himself.

The knowledge from the void surfaced in his mind—techniques for the Forgotten Path, methods to harvest spiritual energy from living cultivators. The process would kill them, of course, their life force and cultivation base absorbed into his growing void. But death was merely the final emptying, the ultimate expression of the path he now walked.

Wei Liang took a step toward the camp, then stopped. The hunger was strong, but some remnant of his former self remained—enough to question whether vengeance was worth becoming a monster.

*You already are a monster,* the voice that wasn't a voice whispered from the emptiness within him. *You died. What returned is something else entirely.*

He looked down at his hands, expecting to see some visible sign of his transformation. They appeared normal, though perhaps paler than before. Yet when he focused his awareness on them, he could see the emptiness that flowed beneath the surface—currents of void energy that had replaced blood and chi.

A new sound reached him—voices raised in alarm from the camp. The disciples had discovered the shattered containment vessel, the missing node. Soon they would organize a search, though not for him. They would seek the valuable artifact, unaware that it had already been consumed, its essence merged with the emptiness that now animated Wei Liang's form.

He turned away from the camp, moving deeper into the Wastes. The chaotic landscape no longer seemed threatening—indeed, it felt almost welcoming, as if recognizing in him a kindred brokenness. Reality distortions that would have harmed a normal cultivator simply flowed around him, the fractured laws of nature acknowledging his own fractured existence.

Wei Liang walked for what might have been hours or days—time had little meaning in the Wastes, and even less to one who no longer lived in the conventional sense. He passed through regions of impossible beauty and horrific corruption, witnessing manifestations of broken reality that would have driven ordinary minds to madness.

Throughout his journey, he experimented with his new abilities. He discovered that he could extend his awareness beyond his physical form, sensing spiritual energy at considerable distances. He could draw small amounts of ambient energy from his surroundings, though the process was slow and yielded little power. Most significantly, he found that the void within him could be shaped and directed, used to affect the world in ways that mimicked conventional cultivation techniques while operating on entirely different principles.

Eventually, he reached a relatively stable area—a valley where reality seemed less fractured than its surroundings. At its center stood a small pavilion, its architecture suggesting an age far predating the cataclysm. Unlike most structures in the Wastes, it appeared completely intact, preserved by formation arrays of incredible complexity.

Wei Liang approached cautiously, extending his awareness to search for threats. He found none—the pavilion was empty of life, though rich with lingering spiritual energy. It had been abandoned long ago, its purpose forgotten along with its creators.

He entered, finding a single room with walls covered in inscriptions. The language was unfamiliar, yet somehow he could understand it—another gift from the node, perhaps, or a function of his transformed state. The inscriptions described the Forgotten Path in detail, confirming what he had learned in the void while adding practical applications he had not yet discovered.

According to the inscriptions, the Forgotten Path had stages of advancement just as conventional cultivation did. He had entered the first stage—Hollowborn—when the node had merged with his dying body. This stage was characterized by the initial transformation of physical form, the awakening of void awareness, and the first stirrings of hunger for spiritual energy.

Further stages were described: Fracture, where the void began to extend beyond physical boundaries; Consumption, where the ability to absorb spiritual energy reached its peak; Dissolution, where physical form became increasingly optional; and finally, Ascension—a state so alien that even the inscriptions struggled to describe it.

Wei Liang studied these descriptions with growing fascination. He had never had a cultivation path before—had been denied the structured progression that gave meaning to disciples' lives. Now he had not just a path but one of the most ancient and forbidden. The irony was not lost on him.

As he contemplated this new reality, a presence manifested in the pavilion—not a physical entity, but a concentration of darkness that gradually assumed a vaguely humanoid shape. It observed him silently for a time before speaking.

"You are newly hollowed," it said, its voice a whisper that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. "Recently transformed. Recently betrayed."

Wei Liang turned to face it, instinctively adopting a defensive stance. "What are you?"

"A guide. A teacher. One who walked the Forgotten Path long before your birth." The darkness shifted, flowing like liquid. "Some call me the Hollow Woman, though I have had many names across many lifetimes."

"Are you alive?" Wei Liang asked, sensing neither spiritual energy nor life force from the entity.

"Not in any way your former sect would recognize," she replied. "I exist in the spaces between conventional states—neither living nor dead, neither physical nor spiritual, neither present nor absent."

Wei Liang considered this. "Why reveal yourself to me?"

"Those who walk the Forgotten Path are few. Those who survive the initial transformation, fewer still. Those with the potential to reach Ascension..." The darkness rippled. "Perhaps one in a thousand years."

"And you believe I have this potential?"

"You were born empty," she said, echoing the voice from the void. "Most who walk this path must create their internal void through decades of specialized techniques. You began with the end result already achieved. It makes you... uniquely suited."

Wei Liang absorbed this information, finding in it an explanation for his lifelong emptiness—the absence of a spirit root that had defined his existence. What had been his greatest weakness was now revealed as his greatest strength.

"What happens now?" he asked.

"Now you learn," the Hollow Woman replied. "Now you grow. Now you consume."

"Consume what?"

"Spiritual energy, to start. The Wastes contain many sources—corrupted formations, remnant artifacts, even the occasional cultivator foolish enough to venture too deep without protection."

Wei Liang thought of Feng Zhao and the other disciples. The hunger stirred within him at the memory, a void-deep craving for vengeance and power intertwined.

"I want to return to the Azure Peaks Sect," he said. "I want them to see what they created. What they discarded."

The Hollow Woman's form shifted, suggesting what might have been amusement. "In time. You are not ready. The sect has elders who would destroy you in your current state, Hollowborn though you may be."

"Then teach me," Wei Liang said, the words emerging with an intensity that surprised him. "Show me how to grow strong enough."

"I will," she promised. "But first, you must feed the emptiness. The hunger will only grow stronger, and if you do not learn to control it, it will control you."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting the necessity. The void within him pulsed with anticipation, eager for the spiritual energy it had been promised.

"There are scavengers camped two valleys east of here," the Hollow Woman said. "Cultivators who hunt for corrupted materials to sell to sects. They are your first prey."

"How do I... consume them?" Wei Liang asked, the concept still alien despite his growing hunger.

"The Forgotten Path inverts conventional cultivation," she explained. "Where they project spiritual energy outward, you will draw it inward. Where they build structures of power, you will create channels of emptiness. I will show you the techniques, but the hunger itself will guide you."

She flowed closer, her darkness enveloping him like a cloak. "Remember this: consumption without purpose is mere appetite. The Forgotten Path requires intention. You must decide what you are becoming with each act of consumption. Without this focus, you will dissolve into the void, another failed practitioner lost to hunger."

Wei Liang considered her words carefully. "I am becoming justice," he said finally. "I am becoming recognition. I am becoming what the Azure Peaks Sect feared most—proof that their understanding of cultivation is incomplete."

"A worthy intention," the Hollow Woman acknowledged. "Now, let us begin your first lesson."

He fell back into his broken body on the corrupted soil of the Wastes. Pain returned, but different now—not the sharp agony of a wound, but the deep ache of transformation. His blood no longer flowed outward but seemed to be changing within his veins, becoming something else entirely. The transformation brought with it strange sensations—a crystalline ringing in his ears that formed patterns almost like language, the taste of metal and ozone on his tongue, and a pressure behind his eyes as if they were being remade to see what had always been hidden.

The sky above had settled into perpetual twilight, neither day nor night but the boundary between them. Wei Liang found he could see more clearly in this half-light than he ever had in full day—details that should have been lost in shadow were perfectly visible, as if darkness itself had become a lens rather than an obscurement.

He tried to move and found that his body responded, though sluggishly. The pain had receded to a dull ache, constant but manageable. He pressed his hand against the ground, feeling the texture of soil and stone with new clarity—every grain distinct, every edge precise.

Yet something was missing. He remembered the warmth of sunlight on skin, the comfort of a fire on a winter night, but these sensations now felt like concepts rather than experiences. He could recall them perfectly, describe them in exacting detail, but could no longer feel them. The memory of warmth remained, but the capacity to experience it had been consumed along with so much else.

A small price, he told himself, for what he had gained. Yet some part of him—a part that still remembered being human—recognized the lie.

As Wei Liang rose to his feet, the Hollow Woman's darkness gathered beside him, her form more distinct now that he viewed it through his transformed senses.

"The first stage is complete," she said. "You are Hollowborn—a vessel of emptiness given form and purpose. Now you must learn to use what you have become."

Wei Liang looked down at the hole in his chest, still present but now seeming less like a wound and more like a window into his true nature. "I'm ready," he said, and meant it.

The void within him pulsed in agreement, hungry for what was to come.
