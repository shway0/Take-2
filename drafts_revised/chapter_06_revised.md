# Chapter 6: First Hunt

The boundary regions of the Shattered Wastes were different from the deeper areas where Wei Liang had spent the past months. Here, reality was merely bent rather than broken—strange and unpredictable, but not actively hostile to conventional existence. Corruption manifested in subtler ways: plants that grew in impossible patterns, animals with minor mutations, weather that changed too quickly to be natural.

It was in these regions that the scavengers operated—cultivators who collected corrupted materials to sell to sects for research or crafting. They were typically outer disciples or independent practitioners, lacking the power or backing to pursue more prestigious opportunities. They worked alone or in small groups, venturing just far enough into the Wastes to find valuable materials while avoiding the more dangerous corrupted entities that dwelled deeper within.

Wei Liang observed a pair of such scavengers from the shadow of a twisted rock formation. They were young men, perhaps in their early twenties, with cultivation bases at the Qi Condensation stage—modest by sect standards but still representing years of dedicated practice. They moved with the caution of those who understood the dangers of their environment but lacked the power to truly control it.

The hunger stirred within Wei Liang as he watched them, the void at his core responding to their spiritual energy. It had been months since his transformation, months of consuming only corrupted entities. The hunger had grown stronger, more insistent, demanding prey that could truly satisfy its expanding appetite.

The Hollow Woman materialized beside him, her darkness flowing like liquid shadow. "They are suitable," she confirmed, her voice a whisper that seemed to absorb sound rather than create it. "Young, inexperienced, their cultivation bases still developing. Perfect for your first true consumption."

Wei Liang nodded, studying the scavengers' movements and techniques. They were harvesting crystallized corruption—small formations that grew like fungi in areas of mild reality distortion. Such crystals were valuable for crafting certain types of talismans and weapons, their unique properties allowing effects that couldn't be achieved with conventional materials.

"Remember what we've practiced," the Hollow Woman continued. "Establish the consumption channels before they detect your presence. Focus on one target first—attempting to consume both simultaneously would be dangerous at your current stage."

Wei Liang had spent weeks preparing for this moment, refining his techniques through simulated exercises and theoretical discussions. The Hollow Woman had been a demanding teacher, accepting nothing less than perfect execution in their practice sessions. Now it was time to apply those lessons to living prey.

"Which one?" he asked, his voice steady despite the hunger's pull.

"The one on the left," she advised. "His spiritual sense is less developed, his movements less precise. He will be easier to approach undetected."

Wei Liang studied his chosen target more carefully. The young man had a water spirit root, judging by the faint blue tinge to his cultivation aura. His techniques were basic but competently executed—standard Qi Condensation methods taught in most minor sects. He moved with the confidence of someone who had made this journey many times before, familiar with the boundary region's particular dangers.

"And if he detects me?" Wei Liang asked, considering contingencies.

"Then you must act quickly," the Hollow Woman replied. "Once a cultivator becomes aware of consumption, they can resist—channeling their spiritual energy in ways that make it harder to absorb. In such cases, physical incapacitation may be necessary before consumption can be completed."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting this possibility. The hunger cared nothing for methods, only results. It wanted to feed, to grow stronger, to transform him further along the Forgotten Path.

He moved from his hiding place, approaching the scavengers with careful stealth. His time in the Wastes had changed him in ways that now proved advantageous—his movements made little sound, his presence created minimal disturbance in the surrounding spiritual energy, and the corruption in the environment responded to him as if he belonged, creating no telltale reactions that might alert his prey.

The scavengers continued their work, unaware of his approach. They had established a small formation to detect corrupted entities, but it was calibrated for the wrong type of threat—designed to identify the mindless aggression of typical corruption rather than the focused hunger of a Forgotten Path practitioner.

Wei Liang circled to approach his target from behind, using a twisted tree as cover for his final positioning. The young cultivator was kneeling beside a cluster of corruption crystals, carefully harvesting them with specialized tools. His companion had moved further away, focused on another cluster beyond a small ridge.

This was the moment. Wei Liang extended his void awareness, creating tendrils of emptiness that reached toward the cultivator. The hunger surged forward eagerly, but he held it in check, maintaining precise control as the Hollow Woman had taught him. Consumption was not merely about appetite but technique—channels properly established, energy flow correctly directed, intention maintained throughout.

The tendrils of emptiness touched the cultivator's spiritual energy, so gently that he showed no reaction. Wei Liang began to establish the consumption channels, creating pathways through which the young man's cultivation base could be drawn into his void. It was delicate work, requiring both precision and patience—too aggressive, and the cultivator would detect the intrusion; too hesitant, and the channels would fail to form properly.

He worked methodically, guided by the techniques he had learned from the pavilion inscriptions and the Hollow Woman's instruction. Each channel connected to a different aspect of the cultivator's spiritual energy—core essence, elemental affinity, technique foundations, memory imprints. Together, they would allow for complete consumption, not just of power but of knowledge and experience as well.

The cultivator paused in his work, a slight frown crossing his face. He had sensed something—not the consumption channels themselves, but perhaps a vague discomfort, an intuitive warning that something was wrong. He looked around, his hand moving to the spirit sword at his belt.

Wei Liang remained perfectly still, maintaining the partially established channels while suppressing any outward manifestation of his presence. The moment stretched, tense with possibility. Then the cultivator's companion called out a question from beyond the ridge, breaking the moment of suspicion. The young man replied, his attention diverted, his guard lowering once more.

Wei Liang completed the channel establishment, creating a perfect network for consumption. Now came the critical phase—the actual drawing of spiritual energy from cultivator to void. This would be immediately noticeable, giving the prey only moments to react before weakness overcame him.

He focused on his core intention—justice, recognition, proof—shaping the consumption according to his will rather than surrendering to mere appetite. Then he activated the channels, beginning the flow of spiritual energy.

The effect was immediate. The cultivator gasped, dropping his harvesting tools as he felt his spiritual energy being drained. He tried to stand but stumbled, already weakening as his cultivation base was pulled away from him. His eyes widened with shock and fear as he turned, searching for the source of the attack.

Wei Liang stepped from behind the twisted tree, allowing himself to be seen. The cultivator's expression shifted from fear to confusion as he beheld the strange figure before him—a young man with a perfect circular hole through his chest, eyes dark as the void, skin pale as death.

"What—" the cultivator began, but his voice failed as more of his spiritual energy flowed into Wei Liang's emptiness.

The consumption accelerated, the hunger growing more efficient as it fed. Wei Liang maintained his focus, directing the process according to his intention rather than allowing random absorption. He could feel the cultivator's knowledge and experience flowing into him along with his power—techniques for water manipulation, methods for harvesting corruption safely, memories of training in a small sect near the eastern coast.

The cultivator collapsed to his knees, his face draining of color as his life force began to follow his spiritual energy. He tried to call out to his companion, but produced only a weak gasp. His hand fumbled for his spirit sword, but he lacked the strength to draw it.

"What are you?" he managed finally, his voice barely audible.

Wei Liang considered the question, finding in it echoes of his own past wonderings. What was he now? Not a cultivator in the conventional sense. Not merely a practitioner of the Forgotten Path. Something new, perhaps—something born from the intersection of emptiness and opportunity.

"I am what remains when everything is taken away," he replied, the words emerging with a certainty that surprised him. "I am what grows in the absence of light. I am what the Azure Peaks Sect created when they thought they were destroying me."

The cultivator didn't understand—couldn't understand, his consciousness already fading as the consumption neared completion. His eyes glazed over, his breathing grew shallow, and finally, he slumped forward, empty as the void that had consumed him.

Wei Liang stood motionless, processing what he had gained. The cultivator's spiritual energy was different from the corrupted entities he had consumed before—cleaner, more structured, more potent. It filled his emptiness without diminishing it, expanding his capacity while strengthening his existing abilities.

More significantly, he had gained knowledge—techniques and methods he could actually use, unlike the theoretical understanding he had accumulated during his years in the sect. He now knew how to manipulate water essence, how to establish basic formation arrays, how to perform the fundamental circulation techniques of Qi Condensation.

The Hollow Woman materialized beside him, her darkness flowing around the fallen cultivator without disturbing him. "Well done," she said. "A clean consumption. You maintained your intention throughout."

Wei Liang nodded, still integrating the knowledge and power he had gained. "It was... easier than I expected."

"The first consumption of true cultivation is often surprising in its simplicity," she replied. "The difficulty increases with the strength of the prey. This one was weak, his spiritual sense undeveloped, his techniques basic. More powerful cultivators will present greater challenges."

As if summoned by her words, a shout came from beyond the ridge—the second scavenger, returning to check on his companion. Wei Liang turned toward the sound, the hunger stirring again despite its recent feeding. One consumption had not been enough to satisfy it completely.

"Another opportunity," the Hollow Woman observed. "This one will be more alert, having heard his companion's distress. A different approach will be required."

Wei Liang considered his options. The direct method he had used on the first cultivator would not work on someone already suspicious. He would need to adapt, to use the knowledge he had just gained to create an advantage.

The second scavenger appeared at the top of the ridge, his expression shifting from concern to horror as he saw his companion's body. He drew his spirit sword immediately, its blade glowing with earth essence—a yellow-brown light that hummed with defensive power.

"Who are you?" he demanded, his voice steady despite his obvious fear. "What have you done to Lin?"

Wei Liang didn't answer. Instead, he extended his awareness toward the corruption crystals scattered around the area. Using the knowledge he had absorbed from his first prey, he established a connection to their unique energy signature. Then, with a gesture that mimicked water manipulation techniques but inverted their fundamental principles, he caused the crystals to shatter simultaneously.

The effect was immediate and dramatic. Corrupted energy burst outward in all directions, creating a localized reality distortion that momentarily disoriented the scavenger. In that moment of vulnerability, Wei Liang moved—not toward his prey but to a position that placed him between the scavenger and his escape route.

The young cultivator recovered quickly, his spirit sword raised in a defensive stance. "You're not corrupted," he said, his eyes narrowing as he studied Wei Liang more carefully. "What are you?"

"Something your sect elders didn't want you to know existed," Wei Liang replied, his voice carrying easily despite the distance between them. "A practitioner of the Forgotten Path."

Recognition flashed across the scavenger's face, followed by deeper fear. "Impossible. The Forgotten Path is just a legend, a story to frighten disciples."

"All legends begin in truth," Wei Liang said, taking a step forward. "All stories have their origins in reality."

The scavenger backed away, maintaining the distance between them. "Stay back! I've trained in anti-corruption techniques. I know how to defend against energy drainage."

Wei Liang paused, intrigued by this claim. The cultivator's fear was genuine, but so was his confidence in his defensive capabilities. Perhaps he did possess techniques that could complicate consumption.

"Show me," Wei Liang invited, extending tendrils of emptiness toward the young man.

The scavenger responded immediately, performing a series of hand seals that created a barrier around his spiritual core. It was a specialized technique, clearly designed to prevent external interference with one's cultivation base. Against conventional energy drainage methods, it would likely be effective.

But the Forgotten Path was anything but conventional. Wei Liang's emptiness flowed around the barrier rather than attempting to penetrate it directly. Where the scavenger had fortified his spiritual core, Wei Liang targeted the pathways that connected core to limbs, the channels through which spiritual energy flowed during technique execution.

The young cultivator realized his mistake too late. He attempted to attack, channeling earth essence through his spirit sword in a technique meant to immobilize opponents. But as he drew upon his spiritual energy, he created openings in precisely the areas Wei Liang had targeted. The consumption channels established instantly, bypassing his core defenses entirely.

"No!" the scavenger gasped as he felt his spiritual energy begin to drain. He tried to adjust his defensive formation, but each adjustment only created new vulnerabilities that Wei Liang exploited with increasing efficiency.

Unlike the first consumption, this one became a battle of techniques—the scavenger deploying every defensive method he knew, Wei Liang countering each with the inverted logic of the Forgotten Path. It was a valuable learning experience, forcing Wei Liang to adapt and innovate in ways that simple consumption had not required.

Eventually, the scavenger's defenses failed completely. His spirit sword fell from nerveless fingers as his cultivation base was drained to critical levels. He collapsed to his knees, his face a mask of disbelief and terror.

"Please," he begged, his voice weak. "I have family. A sister who depends on me."

The words struck something in Wei Liang—a memory of his own, fragmented but persistent. He had once begged too, on the night Feng Zhao had driven a sword through his heart. His pleas had meant nothing to the inner disciple, his life valued only for its expendability.

For a moment, the hunger receded, allowing clearer thought. This young cultivator was not Feng Zhao. He was not the Azure Peaks Sect. He was simply someone trying to survive in a world that offered few opportunities to those of modest talent. His death would contribute little to Wei Liang's true goals—justice, recognition, proof.

But the hunger cared nothing for such distinctions. It wanted to consume, to grow stronger, to transform him further along the Forgotten Path. And part of Wei Liang—the part that remembered years of casual cruelty and dismissal—welcomed that transformation.

The conflict must have shown on his face, for the Hollow Woman spoke from beside him. "Hesitation is natural in early consumptions," she said. "But remember—the Forgotten Path requires sacrifice. Not just from you, but from those whose energy fuels your advancement."

Wei Liang looked at the kneeling cultivator, seeing in him a reflection of his former self—someone of limited potential trying to find a place in the cultivation world. The parallel was uncomfortable, a reminder of what he had been and what he was becoming.

"His knowledge could be valuable," Wei Liang said, seeking justification beyond mere hunger. "He mentioned anti-corruption techniques. Such methods might help me conceal my nature when I eventually return to the cultivation world."

"True," the Hollow Woman acknowledged. "But partial consumption is difficult to control at your stage. The hunger tends toward completion once begun."

Wei Liang considered this challenge, then reached a decision. "I will try," he said. "Not out of mercy, but because precision in consumption will serve my goals better than indiscriminate feeding."

He focused on the established channels, narrowing them to target specific aspects of the scavenger's cultivation base—his technique knowledge, his spiritual sense development, his understanding of corruption and its properties. He deliberately avoided the young man's core essence and life force, areas that would result in death if fully drained.

The process required intense concentration, far more than complete consumption had. The hunger fought his restrictions, constantly attempting to expand beyond the boundaries he had set. Wei Liang maintained his focus through sheer will, his intention—justice, recognition, proof—serving as the framework that guided his actions.

Gradually, the targeted knowledge and energy flowed into his emptiness, adding to what he had gained from the first cultivator. He learned anti-corruption techniques developed by minor sects, methods for detecting and countering energy drainage, approaches to spiritual sense enhancement that compensated for modest talent. Each piece of knowledge integrated with his existing understanding, creating new connections and possibilities.

When he had taken what he needed, Wei Liang severed the consumption channels. The scavenger collapsed fully, unconscious but alive. His cultivation base had been severely damaged but not destroyed—with time and proper care, he might eventually recover, though he would likely never reach the level he had attained before this encounter.

The Hollow Woman observed the outcome with what might have been surprise. "Impressive control," she said. "Few practitioners of the Forgotten Path master partial consumption so early in their development."

Wei Liang nodded, absorbing the praise while monitoring the hunger within him. It was not fully satisfied—the partial consumption had left it wanting more—but it was manageable, no longer the driving force behind his actions.

"What will happen to him?" he asked, looking at the unconscious cultivator.

"If his companion had a communication talisman, others may come searching when they fail to return," the Hollow Woman replied. "Or he may wake and find his own way back to civilization. Or the Wastes may claim him. His fate is no longer relevant to your path."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment, though not without a lingering discomfort. He had spared the young man's life not from compassion but from pragmatism—a decision based on value calculation rather than moral consideration. It was a different kind of coldness than Feng Zhao had shown, but coldness nonetheless.

They left the boundary region before others could arrive, returning to the deeper Wastes where Wei Liang could safely process what he had gained. The two consumptions—one complete, one partial—had significantly increased his power and knowledge. He could feel the changes within him, his emptiness expanding, his control over void energy growing more precise.

"You are progressing well," the Hollow Woman observed as they traveled. "The consumption of true cultivation accelerates development along the Forgotten Path. With a few more such feedings, you may approach the threshold of the Fracture stage."

Wei Liang considered this prospect. "What exactly happens during Fracture?"

"The void within you begins to extend beyond your physical form, creating cracks in reality itself through which you can project your will," she explained. "Where Hollowborn represents the initial transformation and awakening of the void, Fracture marks the beginning of true power—the ability to affect the world directly through emptiness rather than physical action."

"And the cost?" Wei Liang asked, remembering her earlier warnings about memory as currency.

"Significant," she acknowledged. "To progress from Hollowborn to Fracture requires the sacrifice of a foundational memory—something that defines your core identity, that shapes how you understand yourself and your place in the world."

Wei Liang absorbed this information, wondering what memory he would eventually surrender. What part of himself could he afford to lose? What aspect of his identity was worth sacrificing for power?

The questions had no immediate answers, but they would need to be addressed before he could advance further. For now, he focused on mastering what he had gained, integrating the new knowledge and power into his developing techniques.

They returned to their base in the valley of the spiral stream, where Wei Liang began a new phase of training. Using the techniques he had absorbed from the scavengers, he developed methods to conceal his nature more effectively—ways to suppress the visible signs of the Forgotten Path, to mask the emptiness that defined him, to appear as a conventional cultivator to casual observation.

Such deception would be essential if he ever hoped to return to the Azure Peaks Sect. The elders there would recognize the signs of the Forgotten Path if he made no effort to hide them, and they would destroy him before he could achieve his goals. He needed to appear harmless until the moment he chose to reveal his true nature.

The Hollow Woman guided this training with her usual demanding standards, accepting nothing less than perfect execution. "Deception is as much a part of the Forgotten Path as consumption," she explained. "We survive by remaining hidden, revealing ourselves only when advantage is certain."

Wei Liang embraced this philosophy, finding in it echoes of how he had survived in the sect—keeping his head down, attracting minimal attention, revealing his true thoughts to no one. The difference now was purpose—where once he had hidden simply to avoid additional suffering, now he concealed himself to prepare for eventual recognition and justice.

As weeks passed, his control over his abilities grew more refined. He learned to suppress the visible manifestations of his transformation—the darkness of his eyes, the pallor of his skin, even the hole in his chest, which he could now cover with an illusion of intact flesh when necessary. To casual observation, he could appear as an ordinary cultivator, his true nature hidden beneath layers of careful deception.

More importantly, he developed techniques to mask his spiritual signature, making the emptiness at his core resemble a conventional cultivation base. This was the more challenging deception, requiring constant attention and energy expenditure, but it was essential for any future interactions with the cultivation world.

Throughout this period, the hunger remained a constant presence—temporarily sated by the two consumptions but gradually returning to its former intensity. Wei Liang knew he would need to feed again soon, to continue his progression toward the Fracture stage. But he was determined to do so with purpose and precision, not surrendering to mere appetite.

The opportunity came unexpectedly. During one of their excursions to a different region of the Wastes, Wei Liang's enhanced senses detected a significant disturbance—multiple spiritual energy signatures engaged in combat, their power flaring in patterns that suggested a serious confrontation.

"White Lotus hunters," the Hollow Woman identified after extending her own awareness. "Fighting something powerful—a high-level corrupted entity, judging by the energy patterns."

Wei Liang remembered the White Lotus hunters they had observed months earlier—Core Formation cultivators with specialized techniques for combating corruption. They would be dangerous prey, far beyond his current capabilities. But the situation presented possibilities.

"If they're engaged in combat, they'll be distracted," he noted. "Vulnerable in ways they wouldn't normally be."

"True," the Hollow Woman agreed. "But still formidable. A direct confrontation would be unwise."

"Not direct," Wei Liang clarified. "But perhaps we can observe the battle, wait for an opportunity. If one of them is injured or separated from the others..."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted thoughtfully. "A calculated risk. But potentially valuable—White Lotus hunters possess knowledge and techniques that would significantly advance your development."

They approached the disturbance cautiously, maintaining enough distance to observe without being detected. The battle was taking place in a region where reality was particularly thin—a valley filled with crystalline formations that amplified and distorted spiritual energy. The White Lotus hunters, five in total, had formed a specialized combat formation around a corrupted entity of impressive size and power.

The entity resembled a massive serpent, its body composed of interlocking crystal segments that shifted and reconfigured as it moved. Each segment pulsed with corrupted energy, releasing waves of distortion that warped the surrounding reality. It fought with both physical attacks—striking with its crystalline body—and energy-based assaults, projecting corruption in concentrated bursts.

The White Lotus hunters countered with remarkable coordination, their techniques complementing each other to create a seamless defense while enabling precisely timed attacks. They were clearly experienced in fighting such entities, their movements suggesting years of specialized training.

Wei Liang studied their techniques with intense interest, noting how they neutralized corruption, how they maintained their formation despite the entity's attempts to disrupt it, how they gradually weakened their opponent through targeted strikes rather than brute force. There was much to learn here, regardless of whether an opportunity for consumption presented itself.

The battle continued for nearly an hour, the corrupted entity gradually weakening under the hunters' relentless assault. Finally, with a coordinated attack that struck all its vital points simultaneously, they brought it down. The crystalline serpent shattered into thousands of fragments, its corrupted energy dispersing in a final wave of distortion.

The hunters had won, but not without cost. One of them had been injured during the final assault—a young woman whose right arm hung limp at her side, damaged by corruption that had bypassed her defenses. Her companions gathered around her, applying talismans and techniques to neutralize the corruption before it could spread.

"They'll take her back to their order for proper treatment," the Hollow Woman observed. "Corruption injuries require specialized healing methods."

Wei Liang watched as the hunters prepared to depart, establishing a formation that would allow them to transport their injured companion safely. They were vulnerable now—tired from the battle, their spiritual energy partially depleted, their attention focused on their wounded member.

But they were still Core Formation cultivators, still far more powerful than he was, still capable of destroying him if they detected his presence. The hunger urged him forward, eager for the rich spiritual energy they possessed, but Wei Liang held it in check, weighing risk against potential gain.

"Not yet," he decided finally. "They're weakened but not enough. The risk outweighs the benefit at my current stage."

The Hollow Woman's darkness rippled with what might have been approval. "Wisdom often lies in knowing when not to act," she said. "There will be other opportunities, better suited to your developing abilities."

They withdrew before the hunters could detect them, returning to safer territory. Wei Liang carried with him detailed observations of the battle, knowledge that would inform his future training and techniques. He had not fed, but he had gained something potentially more valuable—insight into how elite cultivators operated, how they coordinated their abilities, how they approached threats beyond the experience of most sect disciples.

As they traveled, Wei Liang reflected on what he had witnessed. The White Lotus hunters represented a level of cultivation mastery far beyond what he had seen in the Azure Peaks Sect. Their techniques were more refined, their coordination more seamless, their understanding of corruption more comprehensive. They were, in many ways, the elite of the cultivation world—specialists whose skills had been honed through generations of focused development.

And yet, they too had vulnerabilities. They could be injured. They could be exhausted. They could be distracted by concern for their companions. These were weaknesses he could potentially exploit, given sufficient power and the right circumstances.

"You're thinking of them as future prey," the Hollow Woman observed, reading his expression.

"Not immediately," Wei Liang clarified. "But eventually, yes. Their knowledge would be valuable, their techniques useful for my goals."

"An ambitious target," she acknowledged. "But not impossible, with proper development. The Forgotten Path allows for growth that conventional cultivation cannot match, given sufficient consumption and sacrifice."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting both the possibility and its requirements. He would need to consume more, to advance further along the path, to sacrifice more of himself before he could challenge cultivators of such caliber. But the prospect no longer seemed as distant or impossible as it once had.

They returned to their base, where Wei Liang began incorporating his observations of the White Lotus hunters into his training. He developed new techniques based on their coordination methods, adapted their corruption neutralization approaches to serve his own purposes, and refined his understanding of high-level combat strategies.

Throughout this period, the hunger continued to grow, gradually returning to the intensity it had reached before his previous consumptions. Wei Liang knew he would need to feed again soon, to maintain his progression and prevent the hunger from becoming unmanageable. But he was determined to do so with purpose and precision, selecting targets that would contribute meaningfully to his goals rather than merely satisfying appetite.

"There are other scavengers who operate in the boundary regions," the Hollow Woman suggested. "Or we could venture beyond the Wastes, into the surrounding territories. Minor sects and independent cultivators can be found throughout the area, many with knowledge and techniques that would complement what you've already gained."

Wei Liang considered these options, weighing potential benefits against risks. Venturing beyond the Wastes would mean leaving the environment where his nature was least conspicuous, where reality itself provided a form of camouflage for his unusual abilities. But it would also provide access to a wider range of prey, to cultivators with different techniques and traditions than those he had encountered thus far.

"Beyond the Wastes," he decided finally. "But not far. The border territories, where minor sects establish outposts to monitor corruption spread."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been a nod. "A reasonable choice. Such outposts are typically staffed by mid-level cultivators—powerful enough to provide substantial energy but not so strong as to present excessive risk."

They prepared for the journey, with Wei Liang refining his concealment techniques to ensure he could pass as a conventional cultivator if observed from a distance. He couldn't maintain the deception during actual consumption, but he could approach potential prey without immediately revealing his true nature.

As they prepared to depart, Wei Liang paused, looking back at the valley that had been his home and training ground for months. It had become familiar, almost comfortable—a place where his fractured nature fit the fractured reality around it. Leaving, even temporarily, meant facing a world that would view him as an abomination if his true nature were discovered.

"Doubt?" the Hollow Woman asked, observing his hesitation.

"Consideration," Wei Liang corrected. "Of what I was, what I am, what I'm becoming."

"And what conclusion do you reach?"

He thought of the Azure Peaks Sect, of Feng Zhao's sword piercing his heart, of years spent as the sect's forgotten shadow. He thought of the emptiness that had always defined him, now transformed into a source of power rather than weakness. He thought of the hunger that drove him forward, the knowledge he had gained, the abilities he had developed.

"That I am exactly what they created," he said finally. "And exactly what they feared."

The Hollow Woman's darkness rippled with what might have been satisfaction. "Then you are ready for what comes next."

They left the valley, traveling toward the eastern boundary of the Wastes. As they moved, Wei Liang felt the hunger stir within him, eager for what lay ahead. The void at his core pulsed with anticipation, hungry for the spiritual energy it would soon consume.

The first hunt had been successful. The next would bring him closer to the Fracture stage, closer to the power he needed to achieve his goals. Closer to the day when he would return to the Azure Peaks Sect and show them exactly what their actions had created.

The void within him pulsed in agreement, hungry for what was to come.
