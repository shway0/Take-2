# Narrative Dependencies

## Character Dependencies
- Character motivations depend on being born without spirit root or cultivation potential, raised alongside other inner disciples but always treated as expendable, betrayed and left for dead during a mission
- Character dynamics influenced by The Shattered Wastes transformation from battlefield of forgotten gods to cursed graveyard

## Plot Dependencies
- The Forgotten Path connects to the corrosion of self through power, and the violent consequences of betrayal and survival
- Timeline events depend on character motivations
- Resolution depends on the Forgotten Path serving as both weapon and curseâ€”devouring cultivation, destroying tradition, and corrupting the user and the world

## Thematic Dependencies
- The corrosion of self through power manifests through character actions
- Setting transformation reinforces thematic elements of isolation twisted into power, pain as transformation, memory as currency, erosion of identity, and defiance against the entitled strong
