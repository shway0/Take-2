# Chapter 4: The Void Between

Death was not what Wei Liang had expected.

There was no sudden darkness, no immediate release. Instead, consciousness ebbed and flowed like a tide against broken shores. One moment, he felt the sharp stones beneath his back, the next, nothing at all. His blood—warm then cold—pooled beneath him, seeping into the corrupted soil of the Shattered Wastes.

Pain came in waves. When present, it consumed everything—a symphony of agony as his body struggled against the inevitable. The wound across his chest burned as though Feng Zhao's spiritual attack still sliced through him, over and over, an endless loop of betrayal made physical.

Then, mercifully, the pain would recede, replaced by a floating sensation. In these moments, Wei Liang found himself elsewhere—or perhaps nowhere at all.

*Is this dying?* The thought drifted through his mind, detached and curious rather than frightened. *So slow. So... incomplete.*

Time lost meaning. The sky above him cycled through impossible colors—the fractured reality of the Wastes reflecting his fractured consciousness. Sometimes it appeared as normal daylight, other times as deepest night studded with stars that moved in patterns no astronomer had ever recorded. Occasionally, it became something else entirely—a swirling void that seemed to watch him with patient interest.

During one moment of clarity, Wei Liang tried to move. His body refused to respond, heavy and distant as though it belonged to someone else. Only his eyes obeyed, allowing him to see the extent of his situation. The containment vessel lay shattered beside him, crystalline shards scattered across the ground. The node it had held was nowhere to be seen, though the air around him shimmered with residual energy.

His robes were soaked through with blood—too much blood for anyone to survive losing. The rational part of his mind, still functioning despite everything, calculated that he should already be dead. That he remained conscious at all defied explanation.

Darkness claimed him again, deeper this time. When awareness returned, the quality of light had changed. How much time had passed? Hours? Days? In the Wastes, such distinctions meant little.

A sound reached him—not physical, but a vibration that resonated directly in his mind. It reminded him of the whispers he had heard when passing through the reality fissure, but clearer now, more focused. As if whatever spoke had found its intended audience.

*Empty vessel,* it seemed to say, though no words were actually spoken. *Hollow one.*

Wei Liang tried to respond but could form no words. His lips were cracked, his throat parched beyond function. Instead, he directed his thoughts toward the presence he sensed.

*Who are you?*

No answer came, but the air around him grew heavier, charged with potential. The shattered fragments of the containment vessel began to vibrate, tiny crystalline notes rising into a discordant melody.

Darkness claimed him once more.

When consciousness returned, Wei Liang found himself standing in the Azure Peaks Sect's main courtyard. The familiar stone paths and elegant buildings surrounded him, exactly as he remembered. Disciples moved about their daily routines—practicing formations, carrying supplies, hurrying to lessons.

None looked at him. None acknowledged his presence.

*A memory,* he realized. *Or a dying dream.*

He tried to touch a passing disciple, but his hand passed through the young man's shoulder like smoke. The sensation was disorienting—he could feel his body moving, yet it had no substance in this place.

Wei Liang wandered through the memory-sect, observing scenes from his life there. He saw himself as a child, newly arrived, sleeping in the servants' quarters with other orphans and castoffs. He watched his younger self carrying water, sweeping floors, enduring casual cruelty with downcast eyes.

The scenes shifted forward in time. He witnessed his unexpected elevation to outer disciple status, the confusion and resentment it generated among the other servants. He saw Master Jing examining him with clinical interest, making notes in a leather-bound book while young Wei Liang performed basic exercises that never produced a hint of spiritual energy.

*Why did you elevate me?* Wei Liang wondered, watching the elder's inscrutable face. *What were you looking for?*

The memory offered no answers, simply fading into another: Wei Liang in the sect library, secretly reading cultivation manuals by candlelight, memorizing meridian paths and energy circulation techniques he could never implement.

Each memory flowed into the next without clear transitions. He saw countless moments of humiliation at Feng Zhao's hands, each one burning with fresh pain despite the years that had passed. He witnessed his own stubborn persistence, the quiet defiance that had kept him going when surrender would have been easier.

Then came newer memories—the expedition preparations, the journey to the Wastes, the fateful moment when Feng Zhao's spiritual attack had torn through his chest.

The memories began to fragment, breaking apart like the shattered containment vessel. Pieces disappeared, leaving gaps in the narrative of his life. Wei Liang tried to hold onto them, suddenly desperate not to lose these parts of himself, but they slipped away like water through cupped hands.

*No,* he thought, reaching for a fading image of his first day in the sect. *Don't take that. It's mine.*

*Is it?* The voice that wasn't a voice returned, resonating through the dissolving memories. *What use are such things to one who walks the Forgotten Path?*

The courtyard scene shattered completely, replaced by darkness so absolute it seemed to have substance. Wei Liang felt himself falling through it, or perhaps it was falling through him—direction had no meaning in this void.

*What is happening to me?* he asked the darkness.

*Transformation,* came the reply. *The vessel breaks so that it may be filled.*

Before Wei Liang could question this cryptic answer, the darkness receded. He found himself in a new location—not a memory this time, but somewhere he had never been.

A vast chamber stretched around him, its walls, floor, and ceiling formed from the same crystalline material as the node from the array. The space pulsed with energy that flowed in visible currents, like rivers of light streaming through the air. At the center stood a formation array far more complex than the one they had found in the Wastes—a perfect circle of pillars surrounding a raised platform.

Upon the platform stood figures that defied description. They were humanoid in basic shape, but their forms shifted constantly, as if reality itself couldn't decide on their appearance. They moved with purpose, manipulating the energy currents, shaping them into patterns that hurt Wei Liang's mind to observe.

*The forgotten gods,* he realized with sudden certainty. *Before the cataclysm. Before they were forgotten.*

He was witnessing something impossible—a moment from before the divine war, preserved somehow in the corrupted reality of the Wastes. Or perhaps created by his dying mind as it struggled to make sense of what was happening to him.

One of the figures paused in its work, turning toward Wei Liang as if sensing his presence across the vast gulf of time. Its face—if it could be called a face—seemed to focus, features resolving momentarily into something almost human.

It spoke, and though Wei Liang couldn't hear the words, he felt their meaning imprint directly upon his consciousness:

*We created the paths to ascension, the methods by which lesser beings might approach our state. But for every path forged, a shadow path forms—an inverse, a reflection. We hid these shadow paths, for they lead to power through destruction rather than creation.*

The figure's form began to blur again, its momentary clarity fading.

*The Forgotten Path is one such shadow. It consumes rather than builds. It empties rather than fills. It breaks rather than forges. And yet, in breaking, it creates something new—something that should not be.*

The vision began to dissolve, the crystalline chamber breaking apart into fragments that swirled around Wei Liang like a storm.

*Why show me this?* Wei Liang asked as the fragments closed in around him.

*You have already chosen,* came the reply, though whether from the figure or from somewhere else, he couldn't tell. *I merely show you what your choice means.*

The fragments struck him all at once, a thousand crystalline shards piercing his form. There was no pain—his body wasn't really here, after all—but he felt each entry as a cold shock, like plunging into winter water. The shards didn't stop at his skin but continued inward, replacing blood and bone and tissue with their crystalline substance.

Wei Liang tried to scream, but his mouth was gone, replaced by the same crystal that now formed the rest of him. For a moment, he was aware of himself as something inhuman—a crystalline statue in the shape of a man, hollow inside, waiting to be filled.

Then even that awareness shattered.

He fell back into his broken body on the corrupted soil of the Wastes. Pain returned, but different now—not the sharp agony of a wound, but the deep ache of transformation. His blood no longer flowed outward but seemed to be changing within his veins, becoming something else entirely.

The sky above had settled into perpetual twilight, neither day nor night but the boundary between them. Wei Liang found he could see more clearly in this half-light than he ever had in full day—details that should have been lost in shadow were perfectly visible, as if darkness itself had become a lens rather than an obscurement.

*Get up.*

The command came from within and without simultaneously—his own thought and something else's, indistinguishable from each other. His body, which had been unresponsive for what felt like eternity, suddenly obeyed. Muscles that should have been too damaged to function contracted smoothly. Limbs that should have been stiff with rigor moved with fluid grace.

Wei Liang stood, looking down at himself with detached curiosity. The wound across his chest remained, but it no longer bled. Instead, the edges had sealed with something that resembled frost, tiny crystalline structures binding the torn flesh together. His robes, stiff with dried blood, cracked and flaked as he moved, revealing skin beneath that was paler than it should have been, with a faint translucence like fine porcelain.

He raised a hand to his face, fingers exploring features that felt both familiar and strange. His cheeks were hollowed, his eyes sunken deeper into their sockets. When he touched his chest, he felt no heartbeat—or rather, he felt something pulsing, but at a rhythm too slow and irregular to sustain human life.

*What am I becoming?* he wondered, the question directed at both himself and the presence he still sensed within him.

*The first disciple of the Forgotten Path in an age,* came the reply. *The vessel through which the forgotten shall return to memory.*

Wei Liang looked around, seeing the Shattered Wastes with new eyes. The corruption and distortion that had seemed so alien before now appeared almost beautiful—a canvas of possibility where reality could be rewritten. The very wrongness of this place resonated with the wrongness now growing within him.

He took a step, then another, testing this new body that was his yet not entirely his. Movement came easily, too easily—as if gravity had less hold on him than before. The ground beneath his feet frosted slightly where he stepped, tiny crystals forming and then sublimating back into the air.

A sound caught his attention—a distant cry of pain or fear. Wei Liang turned toward it, his senses extending beyond normal human range. He could perceive the source: a group of disciples, Azure Peaks by their robes, moving cautiously through the Wastes perhaps half a mile away. A search party, he realized. Looking for survivors. Looking for the artifact.

Looking for him.

Something stirred within Wei Liang at the sight of those familiar robes—a complex emotion that took him a moment to identify. Not quite anger, not quite hatred, but a cold, implacable purpose. These were Feng Zhao's people. The ones who had left him to die. The ones who upheld a system that had deemed him worthless from birth.

*They will not recognize you now,* the voice within him suggested. *You could approach. Listen. Learn.*

Wei Liang considered this. Part of him—the calculating survivor who had endured years of abuse at the sect—appreciated the tactical advantage. But another part, the part that was rapidly becoming dominant, wanted something else entirely.

He wanted them to know exactly who he was. He wanted to see the recognition in their eyes, followed by the fear. He wanted them to understand that the rootless nothing they had discarded had returned as something terrible.

*Patience,* the voice counseled. *You are newly born to this path. Your power is but a fraction of what it will become.*

Reluctantly, Wei Liang acknowledged the wisdom in this. He was changed, yes, but still vulnerable. Still learning what he had become. The time for confrontation would come, but not yet.

He turned away from the search party, moving deeper into the Wastes. Each step felt more natural than the last as he adjusted to his transformed body. The pain had faded entirely now, replaced by a strange hollowness—an emptiness at his core that somehow didn't feel like absence but like potential.

As he walked, Wei Liang became aware of another sensation: hunger. Not physical hunger for food—he suspected his body no longer required such sustenance—but a deeper, more fundamental craving. A hunger for something he couldn't name but could sense all around him in the corrupted energy of the Wastes.

Instinctively, he reached out with senses he hadn't possessed before, drawing some of that energy toward him. It came willingly, almost eagerly, flowing into the emptiness within him like water into a vessel. The sensation was intoxicating—a rush of power unlike anything he had experienced in his previous life.

For someone who had been denied spiritual energy his entire existence, who had been told repeatedly that he lacked the fundamental capacity to cultivate, this moment was revelation. The irony wasn't lost on him: he had finally found a path to power, but only after being broken beyond repair.

*Not broken,* the voice corrected. *Emptied. The rootless are rare and precious—vessels without predetermined shape, capable of holding what others cannot.*

Wei Liang absorbed this information as he continued walking, putting distance between himself and the search party. The landscape around him grew increasingly distorted—reality fissures more frequent, gravity more variable, time flowing at inconsistent rates. None of these phenomena bothered him now. If anything, he felt more at home in these broken spaces than he ever had in the ordered world of the sect.

He came to a place where a reality fissure had torn open a permanent gap between locations. Through it, he could see a different part of the Wastes—a valley filled with crystalline formations similar to the node from the array. The sight triggered a resonance within him, a recognition that drew him forward.

Wei Liang stepped through the fissure without hesitation, experiencing a momentary sensation of being everywhere and nowhere simultaneously before emerging on the other side. The valley spread before him, glittering in the perpetual twilight. At its center stood a single structure—not a building in the conventional sense, but a formation of crystal that had grown into the rough shape of a pavilion.

He approached it, drawn by an instinct he didn't fully understand. As he drew closer, he saw that the crystalline structure was covered in script—the same ancient writing that had adorned the array and the containment vessel. Here, however, the script was more extensive, forming complete passages rather than fragmentary phrases.

Wei Liang reached out, fingers tracing the symbols. To his surprise, he could understand them—not through knowledge of the language, but through a direct comprehension that bypassed normal translation. The writing described the Forgotten Path in detail—its origins, its stages, its powers and costs.

*The First Hollowing,* he read. *The vessel is emptied through trauma, creating space for the void to enter. The body survives while the self begins to erode. The Hollowborn can absorb minor spiritual attacks, conceal their presence from spiritual senses, and convert pain to power.*

Wei Liang recognized his current state in this description. The Hollowborn—the first stage of the Forgotten Path. The beginning of a journey that would transform him further with each step.

He continued reading, learning of the stages that awaited him: Fracture, Void, Unmaker, and finally, the Nameless. Each promised greater power, and each demanded greater sacrifice—memories, identity, humanity itself.

The price was high. But as Wei Liang stood in the valley of crystals, the emptiness within him hungering for fulfillment, he found he did not care. What use was humanity to one who had been treated as less than human? What value were memories of pain and rejection? What worth was an identity forged in the crucible of others' contempt?

He had been Wei Liang, the rootless disciple, the eternal servant, the expendable tool. That person had died in the Wastes, betrayed by those he had served faithfully.

What rose in his place would be something else entirely. Something that would make Feng Zhao and the Azure Peaks Sect remember the one they had tried to forget.

As this resolution crystallized within him, Wei Liang felt a shift in his transformed body. The emptiness at his core pulsed, responding to his determination. The script on the crystalline pavilion began to glow, resonating with the same energy.

*The Path recognizes its disciple,* the voice within him observed. *Now begins your true cultivation.*

Wei Liang raised his hands before his face, watching as the veins beneath his translucent skin darkened, carrying something that was no longer blood through his transformed body. The frost-like substance that had sealed his chest wound spread slightly, forming patterns like branching crystals across his skin.

He closed his eyes, turning his awareness inward as he had practiced countless times while studying forbidden cultivation manuals. But where those attempts had always met with failure—the absence of a spirit root preventing any circulation of energy—now he found something responding.

Not a core of energy forming in his dantian, as traditional cultivation would create, but rather a controlled emptiness—a void that could draw in and consume energy from outside himself. The opposite of traditional cultivation, which generated power from within. The Forgotten Path instead devoured power from without.

Wei Liang opened his eyes, seeing the world differently yet again. Energy patterns were visible to him now—currents and eddies of spiritual power flowing through the corrupted landscape of the Wastes. Some were bright and pure, others twisted and distorted, but all were potentially his to consume.

He extended his awareness, testing this new perception. In the distance, he could sense the search party from Azure Peaks more clearly now—not just their physical presence but the glow of their cultivation. Each disciple shone like a lantern in his enhanced perception, their carefully cultivated spiritual energy a beacon that both attracted and repelled him.

The hunger within him surged at the sight, urging him to approach, to consume, to devour the power they had built over years of privileged cultivation. It would be so easy to ambush a straggler, to feed this new emptiness with stolen energy.

*Not yet,* Wei Liang told himself, forcing the hunger back. *Not until I understand what I've become. Not until I can make them understand what they've created.*

He turned away from the temptation, focusing instead on the crystalline pavilion and its ancient knowledge. Here, in this forgotten place, he would learn. He would master this inverse path of cultivation. He would embrace the emptiness and the hunger, turning them from weaknesses into weapons.

And when he was ready—when the rootless nothing had become something terrible and powerful—he would return to those who had discarded him. Not for mere revenge, but for recognition. To force them to see what their actions had wrought. To make them remember what they had tried to forget.

In the perpetual twilight of the Shattered Wastes, Wei Liang—or what had once been Wei Liang—began his study of the Forgotten Path. The first disciple in an age of a cultivation method that should have remained lost. The empty vessel now being filled with something ancient and ruinous.

Above him, the fractured sky continued its impossible cycles, indifferent to the transformation occurring below. Around him, the corrupted landscape of the Wastes pulsed with energies that resonated with his new nature. And within him, the voice that was both his and not his whispered secrets of power that no living cultivator remembered.

The void between life and death, between human and other, between forgotten and remembered—this was where Wei Liang now existed. And from this liminal space, he would forge a path that would shake the foundations of the cultivation world.

One empty step at a time.
