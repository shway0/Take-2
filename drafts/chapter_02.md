# Chapter 2: The Expedition

Dawn broke over the Azure Peaks Sect with a thin, gray light that promised rain. Wei Liang stood in the expedition preparation hall, a cavernous space normally reserved for inner disciples before important missions. He had arrived before anyone else, positioning himself near the back wall where he might go unnoticed until needed. His few possessions were bundled in a small pack at his feet—an extra set of robes, a wooden cup, a thin blanket, and the dried rations allocated to support staff.

The hall gradually filled with disciples of various ranks, their voices echoing off the stone walls. Most were outer disciples like Wei Liang, though their gray robes were newer, their postures more confident. They clustered in small groups, excitement and apprehension mingling in their conversations. An expedition to the Shattered Wastes carried prestige even for those in supporting roles—assuming they returned.

"...heard there's a formation array from before the divine war..."

"...Elder Shen wouldn't authorize this without good reason..."

"...chance to prove ourselves to the inner disciples..."

Wei Liang absorbed their words without changing his expression. Formation arrays from the era of the forgotten gods were dangerous beyond measure—powerful enough to reshape reality but often corrupted by the cataclysm that created the Wastes. Whatever Feng Zhao sought there, it wasn't mere spiritual resources.

The hall fell silent as the inner disciples arrived, led by Feng Zhao himself. He wore combat robes rather than the formal sect attire, with protective talismans sewn into the fabric and a wooden sword sheathed at his waist. Behind him came five other inner disciples, all at least at the late stages of Foundation Establishment, their expressions serious and focused.

Feng Zhao surveyed the assembled disciples, his gaze passing over Wei Liang without acknowledgment. "The expedition to the Shattered Wastes begins today. Our objective is to locate and retrieve a specific artifact from the eastern quadrant. You've all been selected for your particular skills."

Wei Liang kept his face carefully neutral. His "particular skill" was his expendability, nothing more.

"The journey will take three days to reach the Wastes' periphery," Feng Zhao continued. "Once there, we'll establish a base camp. Inner disciples will form the exploration team, while outer disciples will maintain the camp and secure our retreat path. This is not a training exercise. The Wastes are hostile territory where reality itself is unstable. Follow instructions precisely or risk being left behind."

The threat hung in the air, all the more effective for its matter-of-fact delivery. Wei Liang noticed several outer disciples shifting uncomfortably.

"Equipment distribution will begin immediately. We depart in one hour. Dismissed."

As the disciples moved toward the supply tables, Wei Liang remained in place, waiting until the initial rush subsided. He knew his role would be determined last, after all meaningful positions were assigned. When he finally approached the distribution area, only the heaviest packs remained—tents, cooking equipment, and other burdens deemed too menial for disciples with actual cultivation potential.

"Wei Liang." The supply master checked a list. "You're assigned to general portage and camp maintenance. Take packs seven and twelve."

Wei Liang nodded and lifted the designated packs. Their weight was substantial, designed for disciples who could reinforce their bodies with spiritual energy. For someone without cultivation, they would be punishing over long distances. He adjusted the straps across his shoulders, distributing the weight as evenly as possible.

As he turned to leave, he noticed Liu Mei at another table, carefully packing medicinal herbs into a specialized container. Their eyes met briefly. She gave him a small nod—not friendly exactly, but acknowledging his existence, which was more than most bothered with. Wei Liang returned the gesture before making his way outside.

The expedition assembled in the sect's main courtyard under a sky heavy with unshed rain. Twenty disciples in total—six inner and fourteen outer—arranged in formation with Feng Zhao at the lead. Wei Liang took his place at the rear, where the weakest and least important traditionally stood. From this position, he could observe everyone while remaining largely unnoticed.

A small crowd had gathered to see them off, mostly other disciples and a few elders. Wei Liang scanned the onlookers, surprised to find Yun Hua among them. She stood slightly apart from the others, her expression thoughtful. When her gaze met his, she made a subtle gesture with her hand—a water element sign for caution. Wei Liang blinked in acknowledgment, careful not to show any other reaction.

Feng Zhao raised his hand, and the expedition began to move. They passed through the sect gates and onto the mountain path that would take them down to the valley below. No one spoke. The only sounds were footsteps on stone and the distant rumble of thunder.

Wei Liang focused on his breathing as they descended, using techniques he had read about to manage the strain of the heavy packs. Each step sent jolts of pain through his shoulders and back, but he kept pace, knowing that falling behind would only draw unwanted attention.

The rain began as they reached the valley floor, a gentle shower that quickly intensified into a downpour. The inner disciples activated water-repelling talismans, creating invisible barriers that kept them dry. The outer disciples had simpler protective charms that merely prevented their robes from becoming sodden. Wei Liang had nothing, and within minutes he was drenched, his robes clinging to his skin, water running in rivulets down his face.

They continued through the rain for hours, following a trade road that wound through forests and fields. Occasionally they passed small villages where farmers paused in their work to watch the sect disciples march by. Wei Liang noted how the villagers bowed their heads respectfully as the inner disciples passed, then returned to their tasks without waiting for the rear of the formation. To them, he and the other support staff were invisible—an appropriate metaphor for his entire existence.

By midday, the rain had stopped, but the damage was done. Wei Liang's soaked robes chafed against his skin, and his sodden shoes had begun to blister his feet. The weight of the packs seemed to increase with each mile, the straps digging into his shoulders like dull knives. He maintained his pace through sheer determination, focusing on the rhythm of his breathing and the placement of each foot.

When Feng Zhao finally called for a rest, Wei Liang carefully lowered his packs to the ground, keeping his face impassive despite the relief that flooded his muscles. They had stopped beside a small stream, the water clear and swift after the rain. The inner disciples gathered upstream, while the outer disciples spread out along the banks.

Wei Liang found a spot downstream from everyone else and knelt by the water. He cupped his hands and drank deeply, the cold water soothing his parched throat. As he straightened, he caught sight of his reflection in the stream—a pale face with hollow cheeks, dark circles under watchful eyes, hair plastered to his skull by the earlier rain. He looked exactly what he was: a burden-bearer, a tool to be used and discarded.

"You should dry your robes while you can."

Wei Liang turned to find Liu Mei standing nearby, her expression neutral but not unkind. Unlike him, she appeared relatively unaffected by the journey, her movements easy and controlled.

"The next stretch has no shelter," she continued when he didn't respond. "Wet clothing in mountain air leads to sickness."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. "Thank you for the advice."

He had spoken to Liu Mei perhaps a dozen times in the three years since his elevation to outer disciple. She worked in the sect's medicine hall, specializing in herb cultivation rather than combat techniques. They had occasionally crossed paths when he was assigned to clean the greenhouses or deliver supplies. She had never been cruel to him, which in the context of the sect made her practically benevolent.

Liu Mei glanced at the heavy packs beside him. "Those are meant for disciples who can channel spiritual energy for reinforcement."

"I manage," Wei Liang said simply.

She studied him for a moment, her practical nature evident in her assessing gaze. "There are pressure points that can temporarily reduce pain. They're not a substitute for cultivation, but they might help."

Before Wei Liang could respond, a sharp voice cut through the air.

"Liu Mei! Are you consulting with our rootless disciple about cultivation techniques? How ambitious of him."

Feng Zhao approached from upstream, his expression one of amused disdain. Two other inner disciples flanked him, watching the exchange with interest.

Liu Mei bowed respectfully. "Senior Brother Feng, I was discussing medicinal matters only. Preventing sickness among the support staff will ensure the expedition's efficiency."

Her practical framing of the interaction was clever, Wei Liang noted. She had presented her assistance not as kindness but as expedition management—something Feng Zhao could hardly object to without seeming petty.

Feng Zhao's smile didn't reach his eyes. "How conscientious. But don't waste too much time. Some vessels are simply too flawed to hold water, no matter how carefully you tend them."

The metaphor was deliberate—a water element saying twisted into an insult. Wei Liang kept his gaze lowered, his face expressionless.

"We resume in ten minutes," Feng Zhao announced, loud enough for all to hear. "Anyone not ready will be left to catch up on their own."

He walked away, his companions following. Liu Mei waited until they were out of earshot before speaking again, her voice low.

"The pressure points are here and here." She touched her own shoulder briefly, indicating locations. "Press firmly for ten breaths when the pain becomes too much."

Wei Liang committed the positions to memory. "Thank you."

Liu Mei nodded once, then returned to her own preparations. Wei Liang quickly wrung out his robes as best he could and used the brief remaining time to massage the pressure points she had shown him. The relief was minor but noticeable—enough to make the difference between endurance and collapse in the miles ahead.

When Feng Zhao called for the expedition to continue, Wei Liang shouldered his packs with renewed determination. The path now led upward, leaving the valley and climbing into the foothills that separated the sect's territory from the wilderness beyond. The terrain grew increasingly rugged, with narrow trails winding between rocky outcroppings and sparse, wind-twisted trees.

By evening, they had reached a plateau where Feng Zhao ordered camp to be established. Wei Liang worked silently alongside the other outer disciples, erecting tents, gathering firewood, and preparing the evening meal. His body ached from the day's journey, but he moved with practiced efficiency, completing each task without complaint.

The camp formed a rough circle, with the inner disciples' tents at the center and the outer disciples arranged around the periphery. Wei Liang was assigned the furthest position from the center—the least protected spot should danger approach during the night. He set up his small tent with methodical precision, then reported for his night watch assignment.

"Third watch," the duty roster keeper told him without looking up. "Northwest perimeter."

The third watch was the most difficult—the deepest part of night when the body craved sleep most desperately. The northwest perimeter faced away from the direction they had come, toward the distant Wastes. Wei Liang accepted the assignment with a bow and returned to his tent.

He ate his portion of the evening meal alone, a simple bowl of rice and preserved vegetables. Around him, the other disciples gathered in small groups, sharing food and conversation. The inner disciples sat apart, their voices carrying as they discussed the days ahead.

"The target location is approximately two days into the eastern quadrant," Feng Zhao was saying. "According to Elder Shen's information, the formation array remains partially intact despite the reality distortions."

"What exactly are we retrieving?" asked one of the other inner disciples.

"A control node from the array. Elder Shen believes it contains cultivation insights from before the divine war."

Wei Liang kept his head down, but his ears caught every word. A control node from an ancient formation array would be incredibly valuable—and incredibly dangerous. Such artifacts were often corrupted by the cataclysm that created the Wastes, their functions twisted in unpredictable ways.

As darkness fell, the camp grew quiet. Wei Liang retreated to his tent but did not sleep. Instead, he sat cross-legged on his thin bedroll and began the breathing exercises that had become his nightly ritual. Though he could not cultivate in the traditional sense, the techniques still helped prepare his body for the challenges ahead.

He focused on each breath, imagining spiritual energy flowing through the meridians he had memorized from forbidden texts. In his mind, he traced the paths that spiritual energy should follow, envisioning the circulation that would strengthen his body and refine his spirit—if only he had a spirit root to gather that energy.

Time passed in measured breaths until it was his turn for watch duty. Wei Liang emerged from his tent into the cold night air. The sky had cleared after the day's rain, revealing a vast expanse of stars overhead. He made his way to the northwest perimeter and took up his position, scanning the darkness beyond the camp's boundary.

The night was alive with small sounds—the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze, the distant call of night birds, the soft breathing of sleeping disciples. Wei Liang stood motionless, his senses alert for anything unusual. This far from the sect, wild beasts were a concern, though the greater dangers would come when they reached the Wastes themselves.

As the hours of his watch passed, Wei Liang's thoughts turned to what lay ahead. The Shattered Wastes were not merely dangerous territory—they were a wound in reality itself, a place where the laws of nature had been broken during the war of the forgotten gods. Few ventured there willingly, and those who did often returned changed, if they returned at all.

He had read every account of the Wastes available in the sect library, committing the descriptions to memory. Reality fissures that could transport a person miles in an instant. Zones where time flowed differently, where minutes might pass as hours or years as moments. Corrupted spiritual energy that could twist cultivation techniques back upon their users. Strange entities that defied classification, neither beast nor spirit but something in between.

And yet, for all its dangers, the Wastes held a strange allure for Wei Liang. In a place where reality itself was broken, perhaps the rules that defined his existence—that deemed him worthless for lack of a spirit root—might also break. It was a foolish thought, born of desperation rather than reason, but it lingered nonetheless.

Movement at the edge of his vision snapped Wei Liang back to alertness. He turned slowly, careful not to make any sudden motions that might provoke a response. At first, he saw nothing but shadows among the rocks that dotted the plateau's edge. Then a deeper darkness moved—something large and silent, watching the camp from just beyond the perimeter.

Wei Liang remained still, weighing his options. Protocol required alerting the camp to potential threats, but doing so without confirmation would earn him mockery at best, punishment at worst. He needed to identify the intruder first.

Slowly, he reached for a small stone at his feet. With a precise flick of his wrist, he sent it arcing toward the darkness where he had seen movement. The stone clattered against rock, and the shadow moved—not away, as a startled animal might, but toward the sound, with deliberate purpose.

In the faint starlight, Wei Liang caught a glimpse of the intruder—a creature like a mountain cat but larger, with too many limbs arranged in unsettling asymmetry. Its eyes reflected the distant campfire with an unnatural purple glow. A Waste-touched beast, corrupted by proximity to the shattered reality beyond the mountains.

Wei Liang backed toward the camp, keeping his movements slow and his eyes on the creature. When he judged himself close enough to be heard without shouting, he spoke in a clear, controlled voice.

"Waste-touched beast at the northwest perimeter. Approximately thirty paces out."

The camp erupted into activity. Inner disciples emerged from their tents, spiritual energy already gathering around their hands. Outer disciples scrambled for weapons or defensive positions according to their assigned roles. Wei Liang held his ground, continuing to watch the creature as it assessed the suddenly alert camp.

Feng Zhao strode forward, his wooden sword now unsheathed and glowing with green spiritual energy. "Where?"

Wei Liang pointed. "Among the rocks. Felid form, multiple limbs, purple eye-shine."

Feng Zhao narrowed his eyes, scanning the darkness. The creature chose that moment to move, slinking between two boulders with unnatural fluidity. Feng Zhao raised his sword, wood element energy coalescing around the blade.

"Verdant Binding," he intoned, slashing the sword in a precise pattern.

Tendrils of green energy shot from the blade, crossing the distance to the creature in an instant. They wrapped around the beast, immobilizing it mid-stride. It thrashed against the bindings, a sound like grinding stone emerging from its throat.

Two other inner disciples moved to flank Feng Zhao, their own techniques ready. One wielded fire element energy that formed a blazing spear in his hand, while the other manipulated metal element energy into floating needles that orbited his body.

"Waste-touched beasts often travel in groups," Feng Zhao said, his eyes never leaving the captured creature. "Secure the perimeter. Search in pairs."

The disciples spread out, checking the camp's boundaries for additional threats. Wei Liang remained at his post, watching the captured beast as it struggled against Feng Zhao's technique. Its movements were becoming more erratic, its form seeming to shift and blur at the edges.

"Senior Brother Feng," Wei Liang said quietly, "the creature's form is destabilizing."

Feng Zhao glanced at him with irritation, then back at the beast. His eyes widened slightly as he observed the same phenomenon—the creature's outline wavering like heat distortion, its limbs occasionally seeming to pass through the energy bindings rather than being constrained by them.

"Reality fluctuation," Feng Zhao muttered. "We're closer to the Wastes' influence than I thought."

He made a sharp gesture with his sword, and the green energy bindings constricted violently. The creature emitted a sound like shattering glass, then collapsed into itself, its form dissolving into motes of purple light that scattered on the night breeze.

Wei Liang watched the dissolution with a mixture of fascination and dread. The beast hadn't died in any conventional sense—it had unraveled, its corrupted existence unable to maintain coherence once its connection to the Wastes was severed.

"No other threats detected," reported one of the returning inner disciples.

Feng Zhao nodded, sheathing his sword. "Double the watch for the remainder of the night. We'll reach the Wastes' periphery by tomorrow evening—earlier than expected if their influence has already spread this far."

His gaze fell on Wei Liang. "You spotted it first."

It wasn't a question or a compliment, merely an observation. Wei Liang inclined his head slightly, acknowledging without speaking.

"Return to your post," Feng Zhao said after a moment. "Report any further anomalies immediately."

Wei Liang bowed and returned to the northwest perimeter. The encounter had changed something subtle in the expedition's dynamics. He had performed his duty effectively, demonstrating value beyond mere burden-bearing. It wouldn't last—such moments never did—but for now, he existed in the rare space between invisibility and targeting.

The remainder of his watch passed without incident, and when his replacement arrived, Wei Liang returned to his tent. Sleep came in fitful bursts, his dreams filled with creatures that unraveled at the edges and purple light that whispered in voices just beyond comprehension.

Morning arrived with a blood-red sunrise that painted the mountains in ominous hues. The camp stirred to life, disciples preparing for the day's journey with greater urgency after the night's encounter. Wei Liang packed his few possessions and dismantled his tent with practiced efficiency, then reported for assignment.

"You'll take point today," the expedition coordinator told him, to Wei Liang's carefully concealed surprise. "Thirty paces ahead of the main group. Watch for signs of Waste-touched corruption and report back immediately if you spot anything unusual."

Point position was dangerous—the first to encounter threats, with the least support. It was also, Wei Liang recognized, a test. His performance during the night watch had earned him this opportunity to prove his worth—or to serve as the first casualty if they encountered more serious dangers.

He accepted the assignment with a bow and moved to the front of the forming expedition. As he waited for the signal to begin, Liu Mei approached, carrying a small cloth packet.

"Medicinal paste," she said, handing it to him. "For your shoulders and feet. Apply it during rest periods."

Wei Liang accepted the packet with genuine gratitude. "Thank you."

Liu Mei glanced toward the inner disciples, then back to Wei Liang. "Point position after spotting the Waste-touched beast. Interesting."

"A test," Wei Liang replied quietly.

She nodded. "Or expendability dressed as opportunity."

Before he could respond, Feng Zhao gave the signal to move out. Wei Liang secured the medicinal packet in his robes and started forward, maintaining the prescribed thirty-pace distance ahead of the main group.

The day's path led them higher into the mountains, following ancient trails that wound between towering peaks. The air grew thinner, each breath providing less satisfaction than the last. For the cultivators behind him, this posed little challenge—they could supplement their breathing with spiritual energy. For Wei Liang, it meant carefully managing his exertion, finding the balance between maintaining pace and conserving strength.

As they climbed, the landscape began to change in subtle ways. The vegetation grew sparser but stranger—plants with leaves that turned to follow sounds rather than sunlight, flowers that closed when approached, trees whose bark spiraled in mathematically impossible patterns. The wildlife, too, became increasingly unusual. Birds with too many wings circled overhead, while insects with geometrically perfect patterns crawled across stones that occasionally shifted position when no one was looking directly at them.

Wei Liang cataloged each anomaly, reporting back at regular intervals. The boundary between normal reality and the Wastes' influence was not a clear line but a gradual transition, with corruption becoming more pronounced the further they traveled. By midday, there was no doubt they had entered the periphery of the Shattered Wastes.

They stopped to rest beside a stream that flowed uphill in defiance of gravity. The water itself seemed normal when collected in cups or waterskins, but returned to its impossible course when poured back. The inner disciples examined the phenomenon with academic interest, while most of the outer disciples kept their distance, discomforted by the blatant violation of natural law.

Wei Liang used the break to apply Liu Mei's medicinal paste to his shoulders and feet. The effect was immediate—a cooling sensation that penetrated deep into his abused muscles, numbing pain and reducing inflammation. He recognized the scent of several rare herbs, combined in proportions that suggested significant skill. Such medicine would normally never be wasted on someone like him.

As he finished, he noticed Feng Zhao watching him from across the stream. The inner disciple's expression was unreadable, but his attention was deliberate, assessing. Wei Liang met his gaze for a brief moment before lowering his eyes, the proper response for an outer disciple. When he looked up again, Feng Zhao had turned away, deep in conversation with the other inner disciples.

The expedition resumed with Wei Liang again taking point. The trail now led through a narrow pass between two peaks that didn't quite match—one composed of dark granite, the other of pale limestone, their geological impossibility another sign of the Wastes' influence. As he entered the pass, Wei Liang felt a subtle pressure against his skin, as if the air itself had thickened.

He paused, raising his hand in the signal for caution. The expedition halted behind him as Feng Zhao moved forward to investigate.

"What is it?" he asked, his hand resting on his sword hilt.

"The air density changed," Wei Liang replied. "And there's a sound at the edge of hearing. Like whispers."

Feng Zhao frowned, extending his spiritual sense forward. After a moment, his expression sharpened with interest. "A reality fissure. Minor, but active."

He turned and gestured to the other inner disciples. "Formation positions. We'll pass through in controlled sequence."

The inner disciples arranged themselves in a hexagonal pattern, with outer disciples grouped in the center. Wei Liang found himself positioned near Feng Zhao, who began tracing complex patterns in the air with spiritual energy. The other inner disciples followed suit, creating a protective formation that surrounded the entire expedition.

"The fissure extends through the entire pass," Feng Zhao explained as he worked. "We'll move through together. Stay within the formation boundaries. Any separation could result in displacement to unknown locations within the Wastes."

When the formation was complete, they began moving forward as a single unit. As they entered the pass proper, the whispers Wei Liang had detected grew louder, resolving into overlapping voices speaking words that almost made sense. The air shimmered like heat distortion, occasionally revealing glimpses of other places—a vast plain of shattered glass, a forest of trees with mirrored leaves, a city whose architecture defied perspective.

Wei Liang kept his focus on the path ahead, ignoring the voices that seemed to call his name with increasing urgency. The pressure against his skin intensified, as if reality itself resisted their passage. Around him, the other disciples showed signs of strain—beads of sweat on their foreheads, tightened grips on weapons or talismans, quickened breathing.

Halfway through the pass, the fissure's effects intensified dramatically. The glimpses of other places became more frequent and substantial, sometimes overlapping with their current reality. Wei Liang's vision blurred as his mind struggled to reconcile the contradictory input. He stumbled, momentarily disoriented.

A hand gripped his arm, steadying him. To his surprise, it was Feng Zhao, his expression tense with concentration as he maintained the formation while keeping Wei Liang from straying beyond its boundaries.

"Focus on my voice," Feng Zhao commanded. "Count your steps. One through ten, then repeat."

Wei Liang obeyed, using the simple mental exercise to anchor himself against the fissure's disorienting effects. "One, two, three..."

They continued through the pass, each step requiring deliberate effort. The whispers grew to a cacophony, then abruptly ceased as they reached the far side. The pressure vanished, and reality snapped back into focus—still corrupted by the Wastes' influence, but stable in its corruption.

Feng Zhao released Wei Liang's arm and dissolved the formation with a gesture. "Everyone present?"

A quick count confirmed that the entire expedition had made it through intact. Several disciples looked shaken, and one outer disciple was vomiting at the side of the path, his body rejecting the experience of passing through the fissure.

"That was a minor fissure," Feng Zhao said, his voice carrying to all. "The deeper we go, the more severe they become. Remember your training. Focus on concrete details—counting, physical sensations, memorized texts. These can anchor you when reality becomes fluid."

Wei Liang noted the advice, adding it to his mental catalog of survival techniques. He had no formal training to fall back on, but he had his own methods—the breathing exercises, the memorized meridian paths, the cultivation theories he had studied in secret. Perhaps these would serve a similar purpose.

They continued onward, the landscape growing increasingly alien with each mile. Trees twisted into impossible knots, their branches occasionally reaching out to grasp at passing disciples. Rocks floated at eye level, rotating slowly around invisible axes. In one clearing, they found a perfect circle of flowers that aged from bud to bloom to decay and back again in endless cycles that took mere minutes to complete.

By late afternoon, they reached their destination for the day—a relatively stable plateau overlooking a valley that shimmered with distortion. Feng Zhao ordered camp established, with additional protective formations around the perimeter.

"We've reached the true boundary of the Shattered Wastes," he announced as the camp took shape. "Beyond that valley lies the eastern quadrant and our objective. We'll rest here tonight and enter at first light."

Wei Liang helped establish the camp, erecting tents and gathering what passed for firewood in this corrupted landscape—branches that remained warm to the touch long after being cut and occasionally hummed with discordant notes when stacked together. As he worked, he observed the valley below, noting how the distortions formed patterns that shifted and flowed like currents in water.

The Shattered Wastes proper. Tomorrow they would enter one of the most dangerous places in the world, seeking an artifact of immense power and unknown corruption. Wei Liang had no illusions about his role in what was to come. When danger threatened, the expendable would be expended. His only advantage was that everyone, including Feng Zhao, underestimated him—a lifetime of being overlooked had taught him to move unnoticed, to observe without being observed, to survive in the margins.

As night fell, the Wastes revealed new wonders and horrors. The sky above the valley rippled with auroras in colors that had no names, while the darkness between stars seemed to deepen until it formed shapes that moved with purpose. Strange calls echoed from the valley, some beautiful enough to draw tears, others so discordant they set teeth on edge.

Wei Liang took his assigned watch at the eastern perimeter, facing the valley that awaited them. As he stood his vigil, he felt something he had rarely experienced before—anticipation. Beyond that shimmering barrier of broken reality lay the unknown, yes, but also possibility. In a place where the laws of nature had shattered, perhaps the laws that had defined his life might also break.

The thought was dangerous, a seed of hope in soil that had long been salted with disappointment. Yet as he watched the impossible auroras paint the night with their nameless colors, Wei Liang allowed the seed to take root.

Tomorrow, they would enter the Shattered Wastes. Tomorrow, everything might change.
