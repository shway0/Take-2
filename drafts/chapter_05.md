# Chapter 5: Hollowborn

The search party from Azure Peaks Sect moved through the Shattered Wastes like frightened children, huddled together in tight formation, spiritual energy flaring at every unexpected sound. Wei Liang watched them from the shadow of a crystalline outcropping, his newly awakened senses perceiving their fear as clearly as he saw their faces.

Three days had passed since his transformation—or perhaps it had been longer. Time flowed strangely in the Wastes, and stranger still in his altered perception. He had spent these days learning the limits of his new form, testing abilities that would have been impossible in his previous life.

The emptiness within him had grown familiar, a constant hunger that whispered for fulfillment. He had fed it small portions—corrupted energy from the Wastes, ambient spiritual residue from the ancient battlefield—but these were mere morsels. Unsatisfying. The true feast, his instincts told him, would be the cultivated energy of living disciples.

Wei Liang shifted position, moving with unnatural silence. His body felt lighter now, disconnected from normal physical constraints. The wound across his chest had fully sealed, leaving a crystalline scar that occasionally pulsed with dark energy. His skin had grown paler, taking on a translucent quality that revealed shadowed veins beneath. His eyes, when he had glimpsed their reflection in a pool of still water, had become unnaturally deep-set, almost sunken, with an intensity that hadn't been there before.

The Hollowborn. First stage of the Forgotten Path.

The search party paused at a junction where three paths converged. Wei Liang recognized their leader—Disciple Chen, the youngest of the inner disciples who had accompanied Feng Zhao on the expedition. The one who had occasionally shown him small kindnesses. The one who had warned him before they entered the Wastes.

"We've searched this quadrant for three days," one of the other disciples was saying, voice tight with strain. "If Wei Liang survived, we would have found some trace by now."

"Elder Shen's orders were clear," Chen replied, his expression troubled. "We must confirm his status, one way or another."

"He was cut down by Senior Brother Feng," another disciple argued. "No one could survive such a wound, especially not a rootless disciple with no cultivation."

Wei Liang felt a cold amusement at their certainty. How little they understood about survival. About adaptation. About the power that could be found in emptiness.

"And the artifact?" Chen asked, changing the subject. "Any sign of the containment vessel?"

The disciples exchanged uneasy glances. "Nothing. The array site is completely destabilized. Reality fissures have made thorough exploration impossible."

Chen's face hardened. "Elder Shen won't be pleased. That artifact was the mission's primary objective."

"Senior Brother Feng said the vessel was lost when Wei Liang tried to flee with it," one disciple offered. "Perhaps it was pulled into a fissure."

The lie hung in the air, obvious even to those who hadn't witnessed the truth. Wei Liang wondered if Feng Zhao had made it back to the sect, or if the reality fissure had claimed him permanently. The thought brought neither satisfaction nor disappointment—just a detached curiosity.

"We'll make one final sweep toward the eastern boundary," Chen decided. "If we find nothing by nightfall, we return to the sect."

The disciples nodded, relief evident in their postures. None of them wanted to remain in the Wastes any longer than necessary. The corruption here affected even those with strong cultivation, subtle distortions of perception and thought that grew more pronounced with exposure.

Wei Liang waited until they had moved a sufficient distance away before emerging from his hiding place. He could follow them easily—his new senses could track the glow of their spiritual energy even beyond visual range—but direct confrontation served no purpose yet. Better to observe. To learn. To plan.

He turned instead toward the crystalline pavilion he had claimed as his temporary sanctuary. The ancient structure had become his dwelling and his teacher, its inscriptions revealing secrets of the Forgotten Path that no living cultivator remembered. Each day, he absorbed more knowledge, understanding more fully what he was becoming.

The pavilion stood in the center of the crystal valley, its translucent walls catching the perpetual twilight and refracting it into impossible colors. As Wei Liang approached, he felt the structure respond to his presence—a subtle resonance between the emptiness within him and the ancient power contained in the crystals.

He entered through an archway that had no door, moving into the main chamber where the densest concentration of inscriptions covered the walls. The space felt both alien and familiar now, a reflection of his own transformed state.

Wei Liang settled into a cross-legged position at the chamber's center, closing his eyes and turning his awareness inward. The emptiness at his core pulsed in response, a void that hungered for fulfillment. He had learned to control this hunger somewhat, to direct it rather than being directed by it, but the effort required constant vigilance.

According to the inscriptions, the Hollowborn stage was merely the beginning—the emptying that created space for what was to come. To progress further along the Forgotten Path, he would need to consume cultivated spiritual energy directly from its source. He would need to feed on those who had what he had been denied.

The thought should have disturbed him. In his previous life, he had clung to whatever scraps of morality he could afford—small kindnesses, minor principles that separated him from true monsters. But that person had died in the Wastes, betrayed and abandoned. What rose in his place viewed morality as just another luxury denied to the rootless.

A sound from outside the pavilion broke his meditation—a crystalline chime that served as warning. Something approached. Something powerful.

Wei Liang rose fluidly, moving to the archway with preternatural speed. Outside, the twilight had deepened, shadows stretching across the valley floor. Among those shadows moved a figure that seemed composed of darkness itself—a woman-shaped absence that absorbed light rather than reflecting it.

He watched her approach, neither hiding nor revealing himself. His new senses extended, trying to gauge her nature, but encountered only a void similar to his own—an emptiness that hunger couldn't penetrate.

The figure stopped at the base of the pavilion steps, head tilted upward as if examining the structure. When she spoke, her voice had an echo quality, as if reaching him from a great distance despite her proximity.

"The Forgotten Path finds a new disciple," she said, the words neither question nor greeting but simple observation. "How unexpected."

Wei Liang stepped fully into the archway, allowing himself to be seen. "Who are you?"

The figure's form shifted slightly, darkness flowing like liquid. "Names have power, Hollowborn. I surrendered mine long ago." She gestured at herself. "Those who notice me at all call me the Hollow Woman. It serves well enough."

The title resonated with Wei Liang's new knowledge. The inscriptions had mentioned others who had walked the Forgotten Path in ages past—most driven mad by the transformation, a few achieving terrible power before being destroyed by those who upheld the traditional cultivation order.

"You walk the same path," he said, recognizing the similarity in their emptiness.

"Walked," she corrected. "I reached its end long ago, then turned back from the final threshold. Now I merely exist in the spaces between, neither progressing nor regressing."

Wei Liang descended the pavilion steps, closing the distance between them. As he drew nearer, he could see that her form wasn't truly featureless—within the darkness were suggestions of a face, limbs, clothing. Like a person viewed through deep water, details obscured but presence undeniable.

"Why turn back?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's laugh held no humor. "The final stage requires complete surrender of self. I discovered, too late, that I valued what remained of mine." Her form shifted again, darkness coalescing into slightly greater definition. "But you didn't invite me to your philosophical discussion. I came uninvited."

"Why?"

"Curiosity," she said. "It has been centuries since anyone new walked this path. The traditional cultivation sects have been... thorough in their suppression of knowledge."

Wei Liang considered this. The inscriptions had hinted at systematic destruction of information about the Forgotten Path, but hearing confirmation from one who had witnessed it firsthand gave the knowledge new weight.

"They fear what they cannot control," he said.

"With good reason." The Hollow Woman gestured at the valley around them. "The Forgotten Path consumes. It breaks. It unmakes. The traditional paths build and refine—they create stability. We..." She paused. "We create change through destruction. Few civilizations welcome such force within their borders."

Wei Liang absorbed this, finding no argument against her assessment. The hunger within him didn't care for stability or civilization—it wanted only to consume, to grow stronger through the absorption of others' power.

"You didn't answer my first question," he said. "Why are you here? Mere curiosity seems insufficient motivation."

The darkness around her rippled, an equivalent of a shrug perhaps. "The Wastes preserve what should be forgotten. I am its most faithful guardian in that respect." She studied him with eyes he couldn't see but could feel. "When something new emerges—something that walks between traditional cultivation and true corruption—I take notice."

"And then?"

"That depends on you, Hollowborn." She moved closer, her form flowing rather than stepping. "What do you seek from this path? Power? Revenge? Transcendence?"

The question struck deeper than Wei Liang expected. In the days since his transformation, he had focused on survival and understanding, not ultimate purpose. The hunger provided direction but not meaning.

"Recognition," he finally said, the word emerging from some place deeper than thought. "To be seen. To matter. To force those who deemed me nothing to acknowledge what I've become."

The Hollow Woman was silent for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice held a new quality—something almost like sympathy, though filtered through centuries of detachment.

"A dangerous purpose," she said. "More dangerous than you know."

"Why?"

"Because it keeps you bound to them. To their judgment. To their values." Her form expanded slightly, darkness spreading like ink in water. "The true power of the Forgotten Path comes when you no longer care what others see when they look at you."

Wei Liang felt resistance rise within him—not from the hunger, but from the remnants of the person he had been. The servant boy who had endured countless humiliations while dreaming of the day his worth would be recognized. The rootless disciple who had memorized cultivation techniques he could never perform, hoping somehow to transcend his limitations.

"Then what purpose would you suggest?" he asked, unable to keep a edge from his voice.

"I suggest nothing," she replied. "I merely observe that purposes, like names, can become chains. The Forgotten Path offers freedom from such constraints—but only if you're willing to forget what bound you in the first place."

Before Wei Liang could respond, a distant sound caught his attention—voices carried on the wind, approaching from the valley's edge. The search party had changed direction, now moving toward their location.

The Hollow Woman noticed his shift in attention. "Ah. Your former sect-mates approach. Will you hide again, or will you show them what you've become?"

The question wasn't mocking but seemed genuinely curious. Wei Liang considered his options. He was stronger than before, but still new to his abilities. Confronting multiple cultivators, even with the element of surprise, carried significant risk.

"I'm not ready," he admitted, the words difficult to speak.

"Wisdom rare in the newly transformed," the Hollow Woman noted with what might have been approval. "Come. I know paths through the Wastes that even the search parties won't find."

She turned, flowing toward a narrow gap between crystal formations. Wei Liang hesitated only briefly before following. The pavilion had taught him much, but a living guide who had walked the same path offered knowledge of a different kind.

They moved through the crystal valley in silence, the Hollow Woman leading him along routes that seemed to shift as they traversed them—paths that existed in the spaces between stable reality. Wei Liang found he could navigate these liminal spaces with increasing ease, his transformed nature resonating with their instability.

The voices of the search party faded behind them as they entered a region of the Wastes he hadn't explored before. Here, the corruption manifested differently—not in obvious distortions of physics or reality, but in subtle wrongness that was almost more disturbing. Trees that looked normal until one noticed they cast no shadows. Rocks that remained perfectly dry despite the stream flowing over them. Birds that flew in place, never advancing despite their beating wings.

"The Quiet Wastes," the Hollow Woman explained without being asked. "Where corruption turns inward rather than outward. Few cultivators venture here—the distortions are harder to detect until it's too late."

"Too late for what?" Wei Liang asked.

"For them to realize their own cultivation has been inverted." Her form seemed to smile, though he couldn't see her face clearly. "A cultivator might spend hours here, believing they're strengthening their core, only to discover they've been systematically dismantling it instead."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. "But we're immune?"

"Not immune. Compatible." She gestured at their surroundings. "The Forgotten Path is itself an inversion—consumption rather than generation, emptying rather than filling. The corruption here operates on similar principles."

They continued through the Quiet Wastes until they reached a clearing where a single structure stood—a small cottage that appeared ordinary except for the fact that it was constructed entirely upside-down, its roof serving as floor, its door accessible only by walking up walls that functioned as ground.

The Hollow Woman flowed up the inverted wall without difficulty. Wei Liang followed more cautiously, discovering that his body responded to his intention rather than normal physics. Gravity reoriented as he moved, making the impossible transition feel natural.

Inside, the cottage was larger than its exterior suggested—another spatial distortion that no longer surprised him. Furnishings were minimal and strange: chairs that faced walls, tables with objects affixed to their undersides, windows that showed scenes from places that couldn't possibly be visible from this location.

"My dwelling," the Hollow Woman said, her form settling into a more defined shape in these familiar surroundings. "One of several I maintain throughout the Wastes."

Wei Liang examined the space with interest. "You've lived here long?"

"Time is flexible in the Wastes," she replied, "but yes, by any meaningful measure. Since before the Azure Peaks Sect existed. Since before most of the current cultivation world took shape."

The casual mention of such vast timeframes gave Wei Liang pause. The inscriptions had hinted at the longevity granted by the Forgotten Path, but hearing it confirmed made the reality more concrete.

"How far did you progress?" he asked. "Before turning back from the final threshold?"

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely, darkness condensing until he could almost make out features—a woman's face, ageless and severe, with eyes that held no color but infinite depth.

"The Unmaker," she said. "Fourth stage. One step from the Nameless."

Wei Liang recalled the inscriptions describing these advanced stages. The Unmaker could corrupt reality itself, rewriting small aspects of the world through sheer will. Such power seemed godlike, yet she spoke of it with what sounded like regret.

"And now?" he asked.

"Now I exist between stages. Neither advancing nor retreating." Her form expanded again, features fading back into darkness. "The price of indecision."

Wei Liang sensed there was more to her story—centuries of existence compressed into those simple statements—but he didn't press. Instead, he turned his attention to more immediate concerns.

"The search party will report back to the sect soon," he said. "They'll declare me dead if they haven't already."

"And is that not advantageous?" the Hollow Woman asked. "To be forgotten by those who would hunt you? To have time to grow stronger without interference?"

"Perhaps," Wei Liang conceded. "But it feels like..." He struggled to articulate the discomfort. "Like they win. Like Feng Zhao's betrayal succeeds."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been a sigh. "You remain bound to their recognition, even now. Even after the Path has begun to transform you." She moved closer, her darkness cool against his skin. "Let me show you something."

She gestured, and one of the windows changed its view, no longer showing an impossible landscape but a scene Wei Liang recognized—the Azure Peaks Sect's main hall. Within it stood Elder Shen, severe and imposing, addressing a group that included Feng Zhao.

"How—" Wei Liang began.

"The Wastes connect to many places," the Hollow Woman explained. "With sufficient understanding, one can glimpse through these connections. Listen."

Sound accompanied the image now, Elder Shen's voice crisp and authoritative: "...no confirmation of death, but given the circumstances, we must assume Disciple Wei did not survive. The containment vessel and artifact are also lost. This expedition has failed in its primary objective."

Feng Zhao bowed, his expression appropriately solemn. "This disciple takes full responsibility. The array's destabilization was more severe than anticipated. Wei Liang panicked and fled with the vessel despite my orders to remain in formation. When I pursued, a reality fissure opened between us. I was fortunate to escape with my life."

The lie was delivered with perfect conviction, not a hint of the truth showing in Feng Zhao's face or voice. Wei Liang felt a cold rage building within him, the hunger in his core responding to his emotions, growing sharper and more insistent.

Elder Shen's expression revealed nothing of her thoughts. "The loss of the artifact is regrettable. The loss of a disciple, even one without cultivation potential, is a failure of leadership." Her gaze fixed on Feng Zhao. "You will meditate on this failure for thirty days in the Reflection Chamber. Perhaps isolation will improve your judgment."

Feng Zhao's composure slipped momentarily, shock and indignation flashing across his features before he mastered himself. "Yes, Elder. This disciple accepts correction."

The window's view faded, returning to its previous impossible landscape. Wei Liang stood motionless, absorbing what he had witnessed. The casual dismissal of his supposed death. The easy acceptance of Feng Zhao's lies. The concern for the artifact that outweighed any concern for a disciple's life.

"They are exactly as you remember them," the Hollow Woman observed. "Does this surprise you?"

"No," Wei Liang admitted. "But seeing it confirms what I already knew."

"And what will you do with this confirmation?"

Wei Liang turned away from the window, facing the darkness that was his unexpected guide. "Grow stronger. Master this path. And then return to show them exactly what they created when they left me to die."

The Hollow Woman's form shifted, darkness rippling with what might have been amusement or concern. "A predictable response. But not an unworthy one, provided you remember that revenge is merely a beginning, not an end."

"What comes after revenge?" Wei Liang asked.

"That," she said, "is the question that will determine whether you become merely another horror of the Wastes, or something truly transcendent." Her form moved toward the inverted door. "But such philosophical matters can wait. First, you must master the practical aspects of your transformation."

Wei Liang followed her outside, back into the Quiet Wastes where reality turned subtly inward. "You'll teach me?"

"I will show you what I can," she replied. "The rest, you must learn through experience. The Forgotten Path cannot be taught like traditional cultivation—it must be lived, suffered, embraced."

She led him to a small clearing where the inversion of reality was particularly strong. Here, spiritual energy flowed in reverse patterns, cycling inward rather than outward, collapsing rather than expanding.

"The Hollowborn stage focuses on absorption and concealment," she explained. "You must learn to control what you consume and how you appear to others. Begin by extending your awareness—feel the energy around you."

Wei Liang closed his eyes, reaching out with his new senses. The corrupted spiritual energy of the Wastes swirled around him, chaotic and potent. He could perceive it more clearly now than during his first days after transformation—distinct currents and eddies, each with different qualities and intensities.

"Good," the Hollow Woman said, observing him with senses he couldn't comprehend. "Now, draw some of that energy toward you—not all at once, but in a controlled stream. Imagine the emptiness within you as a vessel with a narrow opening, allowing only what you choose to enter."

Wei Liang focused on a nearby current of energy—one that felt less corrupted than others, closer to natural spiritual energy. He extended his awareness toward it, feeling the hunger within him respond eagerly. Too eagerly. The energy rushed toward him in a flood rather than a stream, threatening to overwhelm his control.

"Restraint," the Hollow Woman cautioned. "The Path will always hunger for more than you intend to take. You must impose your will upon it, not merely channel its power."

Wei Liang struggled, fighting to narrow the connection between himself and the energy current. Slowly, with great effort, he managed to reduce the flow to a manageable stream. The energy entered the emptiness within him, cool and potent, filling a small portion of the void.

"Better," she acknowledged. "Though still crude. With practice, you'll develop finer control."

They continued this exercise for hours, Wei Liang learning to select specific energy currents, to control the rate of absorption, to process different types of spiritual essence. The work was exhausting in a way physical training had never been—it taxed something deeper than muscles or breath, straining against the limits of his transformed being.

When they finally paused, the perpetual twilight of the Wastes had shifted toward deeper shadow, indicating the passage of time despite the absence of true night or day.

"You learn quickly," the Hollow Woman observed. "Most new to the Path struggle for weeks to achieve what you've managed in hours."

Wei Liang sensed this wasn't mere flattery. "Why?"

"Your previous emptiness prepared you," she said. "Those who come to the Path from traditional cultivation must unlearn before they can learn. You have less to unlearn."

A bitter irony—his greatest disadvantage in his previous life had become an advantage in his new existence. The absence of a spirit root, which had prevented him from gathering and circulating spiritual energy in the traditional manner, now allowed him to more easily adapt to a path that operated on opposite principles.

"What else must I learn?" he asked.

"Patience," she replied, amusement coloring her echoing voice. "Even the Forgotten Path requires time. But next, we should address concealment. The ability to hide your nature from those who would recognize it as anathema."

She led him to another area of the Quiet Wastes, where the boundary between corrupted and uncorrupted reality was more distinct. Here, normal spiritual energy occasionally flowed in from outside the Wastes, creating pockets of relative stability.

"Traditional cultivators sense others through their spiritual energy," the Hollow Woman explained. "They perceive the presence, strength, and nature of cultivation. What do you think they will sense when they encounter you?"

Wei Liang considered this. "Emptiness. Absence. A void where cultivation should be."

"Precisely. And nothing draws attention like an absence where something should exist." Her form shifted, darkness condensing until she appeared almost solid—a woman in gray robes, her features still indistinct but her form recognizably human. "The Hollowborn can conceal this emptiness, presenting a false front to spiritual senses."

She demonstrated, her presence in his spiritual perception changing from a void to something unremarkable—a minor cultivator of no particular strength or distinction. Someone easily overlooked, easily forgotten.

"How?" Wei Liang asked, fascinated by the transformation.

"By creating a shell of absorbed energy around your core emptiness," she explained, her form returning to its natural void state. "A thin layer that mimics normal cultivation, hiding the hunger beneath."

Wei Liang attempted to replicate the technique, drawing on the energy he had absorbed earlier. Shaping it proved difficult—like trying to form water into a specific shape with bare hands. His first attempts dissipated quickly, the energy either being consumed by his core emptiness or dispersing back into the environment.

"Intention is key," the Hollow Woman advised. "The energy responds to your will, but that will must be precise and sustained."

Wei Liang tried again, focusing more intently on the image he wished to project—a minor cultivator, unremarkable and unthreatening. This time, the energy responded better, forming a thin shell around his emptiness. It felt strange, like wearing a garment made of light, but it held.

"Now move," she instructed. "Maintain the shell while in motion."

This proved even more challenging. With each step, the energy shell threatened to collapse, requiring constant attention to maintain. Wei Liang persisted, gradually developing a divided awareness—one part focused inward on maintaining the disguise, another part engaged with the external world.

"This will become easier with practice," the Hollow Woman assured him. "Eventually, you'll maintain such concealment without conscious thought, as naturally as breathing."

They continued training until Wei Liang could maintain his false appearance while performing basic movements and interactions. By the end, exhaustion had settled deep into his being—not physical fatigue, but a spiritual depletion that made the hunger within him sharper, more demanding.

"Enough for today," the Hollow Woman decided, observing his state with her unseen eyes. "You need to rest and integrate what you've learned."

She led him back to the inverted cottage, where she indicated a space he could use for meditation. Wei Liang settled into a cross-legged position, closing his eyes and turning his awareness inward as he had done countless times in his previous life. The practice felt both familiar and utterly different now—where once he had found only frustration and limitation, now he found the controlled emptiness of his transformed core.

As he meditated, Wei Liang reflected on the day's training and the path that stretched before him. The Hollow Woman had shown him only the most basic techniques of the Hollowborn stage, yet even these exceeded anything he could have achieved as a rootless disciple. And beyond the Hollowborn lay further stages, each promising greater power at greater cost.

The hunger within him pulsed at these thoughts, eager for advancement, for consumption, for growth. Wei Liang acknowledged it without surrendering to it. Control, the Hollow Woman had emphasized. Restraint. Patience. The Path would always demand more than was wise to give.

His meditation deepened, consciousness expanding to encompass his transformed being more fully. He could sense the changes more precisely now—the crystalline structures forming within his flesh, the altered pathways where blood had once flowed, the hollow spaces where organs had been repurposed or rendered unnecessary. His body was becoming a vessel for something other than life as traditionally understood.

In this deepened awareness, Wei Liang also sensed something he hadn't noticed before—a subtle connection extending from his core emptiness outward, beyond his physical form. He followed this connection with his perception, tracing it through the corrupted reality of the Wastes, through layers of distortion and displacement, until he found its destination.

The array. Or what remained of it.

Though physically distant, the connection made it feel immediate, as if he could reach out and touch the destabilized formation. Through this link, he sensed that the array continued its collapse, reality around it fracturing further with each passing day. And at its center, where the node had been extracted, a wound in reality itself pulsed in rhythm with the emptiness inside him.

Wei Liang pulled his awareness back, disturbed by the implications. The node hadn't simply transformed him—it had connected him to the array, to the wound its removal had created. He was linked to the very source of the Wastes' corruption.

He opened his eyes, intending to ask the Hollow Woman about this discovery, but found the cottage empty. His mysterious guide had departed while he meditated, leaving him alone with his questions.

Outside, the perpetual twilight had shifted again, suggesting the passage of hours. Wei Liang emerged from the inverted structure, reorienting himself to the Quiet Wastes. His senses extended, searching for the Hollow Woman's distinctive void presence, but found nothing. She had gone beyond his perception's range.

Alone again. As he had always been, in truth, despite years surrounded by the sect's disciples and servants. The realization brought neither pain nor comfort—merely acknowledgment of a constant in his existence.

Wei Liang considered his options. He could wait for the Hollow Woman's return, assuming she intended to continue his training. Or he could explore further on his own, testing his new abilities and expanding his understanding of the Wastes.

The hunger within him suggested a third option—to seek out living cultivators, to consume their energy directly rather than absorbing ambient spiritual essence. The search party had departed, but others would come. The Azure Peaks Sect wouldn't abandon their interest in the Wastes entirely, not with valuable artifacts still potentially recoverable.

Wei Liang rejected this option for now. He was still too new to his powers, too uncertain of his control. Better to continue learning, to master what he had already gained before seeking more.

He decided to return to the crystal valley and the pavilion where he had first learned of the Forgotten Path. The inscriptions there might provide insight into the connection he had discovered during meditation.

Moving through the Quiet Wastes proved easier than before, his body adapting further to the inverted reality with each passing hour. He maintained the concealment technique the Hollow Woman had taught him, practicing the divided awareness necessary to sustain it while navigating the corrupted landscape.

As he traveled, Wei Liang encountered other denizens of the Wastes—creatures transformed by prolonged exposure to corruption, neither fully animal nor spirit but something between. They sensed his nature and gave him wide berth, recognizing a predator more dangerous than themselves.

One such creature, resembling a fox with too many tails and crystalline growths along its spine, actually bowed its head as he passed, a gesture of deference that would have been impossible for a normal animal. Wei Liang paused, studying the creature with his enhanced perception.

Its spiritual essence had been altered by the Wastes, developing a primitive consciousness beyond its original nature. Not cultivation in the traditional sense, but an adaptation to corruption that had granted it new awareness.

On impulse, Wei Liang reached out with his senses, not to consume but to communicate. The creature tensed initially, then relaxed as it recognized his intention. No words passed between them—the fox-thing lacked language as humans understood it—but impressions flowed: territory, safety, threats, resources.

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. The creature knew the Wastes in ways he did not—the safe paths, the dangerous zones, the places where reality broke down completely. Such knowledge could prove valuable.

He projected gratitude toward the fox-thing, then continued on his way, incorporating its territorial knowledge into his route. The interaction left him thoughtful. If even corrupted beasts could adapt and evolve in the Wastes, developing new forms of awareness, what possibilities might the Forgotten Path open for someone who approached it with intention rather than mere survival?

By the time Wei Liang reached the crystal valley, the twilight had deepened again, shadows stretching longer across the corrupted landscape. The crystalline pavilion stood as he had left it, its translucent walls glowing with inner light that responded to his approach.

He entered the structure, moving directly to the wall section that contained inscriptions about the Hollowborn stage. Reading them again with his expanded understanding, he found new meaning in passages that had seemed obscure before.

*The Hollowborn carries a fragment of the void within. This fragment seeks reunion with its source, creating a tether that transcends physical distance. Through this tether, influence flows both ways—the void shapes the vessel, and the vessel directs the void.*

The connection he had sensed during meditation. The inscriptions confirmed it was an expected aspect of his transformation, not an anomaly. But they also suggested something more concerning—that the influence between himself and the array was bidirectional. The void within him was changing him, yes, but his choices could also affect the wound in reality at the array's center.

Wei Liang continued reading, searching for more specific information about this connection and its implications. The inscriptions became more technical, describing energy patterns and void resonances in terms that stretched his comprehension despite his years of secret study.

One passage, however, stood out with disturbing clarity:

*As the vessel progresses along the Path, the tether strengthens. At the final threshold, vessel and void become indistinguishable. The Nameless emerges as both container and contained, capable of reshaping reality according to its nature. This is both the Path's ultimate promise and its greatest danger, for few vessels retain sufficient self to direct such power toward purpose rather than mere consumption.*

Wei Liang stepped back from the wall, absorbing the implications. The Forgotten Path didn't merely offer power as traditional cultivation did—it offered transformation into something beyond human, something capable of affecting reality itself. But at the cost of identity, of self, of purpose beyond hunger.

The Hollow Woman's warning made more sense now. Her caution about revenge being a beginning, not an end. Without a purpose beyond consumption and retribution, the Path would eventually consume the very self that sought power in the first place.

Wei Liang moved to the center of the pavilion, settling once more into meditation. This time, he deliberately explored the connection between himself and the array, not merely sensing it but testing its nature. He found that he could, with effort, send his awareness along this tether, perceiving the array site directly despite the physical distance separating them.

The array's collapse had continued in his absence. Reality fissures had multiplied, creating a maze of tears in the fabric of existence. The wound at the center pulsed with void energy, drawing in ambient spiritual essence and corrupting it. And around this wound, crystalline structures had begun to form—growths similar to those now developing within Wei Liang's transformed body.

The sight confirmed his suspicions. His transformation and the array's corruption were progressing in parallel, linked through the void fragment within him. What happened to one would affect the other.

Wei Liang withdrew his awareness, returning fully to the pavilion. The implications required careful consideration. If the connection grew stronger as he advanced along the Forgotten Path, would the array's corruption also intensify? Would his pursuit of power accelerate the Wastes' expansion? And if so, what responsibility did that place on him?

Such questions would have seemed absurd to the servant boy who had carried water for the Azure Peaks Sect, or even to the rootless disciple who had secretly studied cultivation techniques he could never perform. But to the Hollowborn he had become, they were unavoidable.

Before he could pursue these thoughts further, Wei Liang's enhanced senses detected movement at the valley's edge. Multiple presences approaching—human, cultivators, their spiritual energy bright and structured in his perception. Not a search party this time, but something more purposeful. More dangerous.

Wei Liang moved to the pavilion's entrance, extending his senses to their maximum range. Six cultivators, all at the Core Formation realm or higher. Their formation was tight and disciplined, designed for combat rather than search. And their spiritual energy carried a particular resonance he recognized from his studies—purification techniques, specifically developed to counter corruption.

Hunters. Specialists in cleansing Waste-touched entities and artifacts.

Wei Liang activated the concealment technique the Hollow Woman had taught him, creating a shell of absorbed energy around his core emptiness. But he suspected it wouldn't fool these cultivators for long—they were trained to detect precisely what he was trying to hide.

He had two options: flee deeper into the Wastes, or observe from hiding to learn more about these new threats. The hunger within him suggested a third option—attack, consume, grow stronger—but Wei Liang dismissed this as suicidal against such opponents.

Choosing observation, he moved from the pavilion to a nearby crystal formation that offered both concealment and a clear view of the approaching cultivators. From this vantage point, he could study their techniques and capabilities without exposing himself unnecessarily.

The hunters entered the valley in arrow formation, a white-robed cultivator at the point position. This leader held a jade compass that glowed with spiritual energy, its needle swinging in different directions as it detected corruption. The other five cultivators maintained a protective formation around him, their weapons drawn and glowing with purification energy.

Wei Liang recognized their robes—not Azure Peaks Sect, but the White Lotus Temple, specialists in purification cultivation who operated independently of the major sects. Their presence suggested the situation in the Wastes had escalated beyond a simple lost artifact. Something had drawn their attention specifically to this valley.

The leader paused, consulting his compass. "The corruption nexus is nearby," he announced, his voice carrying clearly in the crystalline environment. "Recent manifestation, but unusually potent. Possibly connected to the array destabilization."

One of the other cultivators, a woman with a silver sword, gestured toward the pavilion. "That structure isn't natural to the Wastes. It's too ordered, too purposeful."

The leader nodded. "A remnant from before the cataclysm, preserved in the corruption. The compass indicates it's a focal point for void energy."

They approached the pavilion cautiously, maintaining their protective formation. Wei Liang remained perfectly still, controlling even his breathing to minimize any detectable presence. The concealment technique strained under the pressure of proximity to such powerful cultivators, requiring constant adjustment to maintain.

The hunters entered the pavilion, their purification energy creating visible disturbance in the crystalline structure. Wei Liang could sense the conflict between their techniques and the ancient power embedded in the crystals—like oil and water refusing to mix.

"These inscriptions," the silver-sword woman said, examining the walls. "They describe a cultivation method. One I've never encountered in any orthodox text."

The leader approached the wall, his expression grave as he studied the ancient writing. "The Forgotten Path. One of the inverse methods from before the divine war. This shouldn't exist anymore—the Purification Conclave eradicated all records centuries ago."

"Yet here it stands," another hunter observed. "Preserved in the Wastes all this time."

The leader's face hardened. "And recently used. These energy signatures are fresh—someone has been here, reading these inscriptions, absorbing this knowledge."

Wei Liang tensed, preparing to flee if necessary. The hunters were too close to his position, their senses too acute. If they expanded their detection range even slightly, they would find him despite his concealment.

"Could it be connected to the Azure Peaks expedition?" the silver-sword woman asked. "They lost a disciple and an artifact in this region."

"Possible," the leader conceded. "Though a normal disciple couldn't interpret these inscriptions, let alone implement the techniques they describe."

"Unless they weren't normal," another hunter suggested. "The lost disciple was rootless, according to the report. No spirit root, no cultivation potential."

The leader's head snapped up, his expression changing from concern to alarm. "Rootless? You're certain?"

The hunter nodded. "That's what the Azure Peaks representative told the Conclave. A rootless disciple named Wei Liang, presumed dead after a confrontation with reality fissures."

"Heavens preserve us," the leader whispered, his face paling. "We need to report this immediately. If a rootless individual has found the Forgotten Path..."

He didn't finish the thought, but the other hunters' expressions reflected his alarm. They began a hasty examination of the pavilion, collecting energy samples and copying select inscriptions into jade slips for later study.

Wei Liang remained hidden, absorbing this unexpected information. The hunters feared the combination of rootlessness and the Forgotten Path specifically. Why? What made his particular condition so alarming to these specialists?

The inscriptions hadn't mentioned any special connection between rootlessness and the Path. The Hollow Woman hadn't indicated his lack of spirit root was significant beyond making adaptation easier. Yet these hunters, experts in their field, reacted with near panic to the possibility.

There was knowledge here he lacked, context he didn't possess. And that ignorance could prove dangerous.

The hunters completed their investigation of the pavilion and began a systematic search of the surrounding area. Their search pattern would bring them dangerously close to Wei Liang's hiding place within minutes. He needed to move, but any movement risked detection.

Drawing on the concealment technique, Wei Liang focused on projecting absolute stillness—not just physical immobility but spiritual quiescence. The emptiness within him, usually hungry and active, he temporarily compressed to its smallest possible state, reducing his detectable presence to nearly nothing.

The effort was enormous, like trying to compress water with bare hands. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite his transformed physiology, and the strain threatened to shatter his concentration. But he held, motionless and nearly undetectable, as the hunters passed within feet of his position.

The silver-sword woman paused, frowning, her senses clearly detecting something amiss. She turned slowly, gaze passing over Wei Liang's hiding place without focusing on him specifically.

"Something's here," she said quietly. "But it's... strange. Like looking at a shadow from the corner of your eye."

The leader joined her, his jade compass extended. The needle swung erratically, unable to fix on Wei Liang's compressed emptiness. "The corruption makes detection unreliable. We'll need to perform a purification sweep of the entire valley before we can be certain."

They moved away, rejoining the other hunters who had completed their search of the immediate area. Wei Liang remained frozen, maintaining his compressed state despite the mounting strain. Only when the hunters had moved to the valley's far side did he dare release the technique, his emptiness expanding back to its normal state with an almost audible snap.

The hunger surged back immediately, intensified by the effort of compression. Wei Liang fought it down, focusing on the immediate need to escape before the hunters began their purification sweep. Such techniques would likely cause him significant harm in his current state, perhaps even reverse his transformation entirely.

Moving with preternatural silence, Wei Liang slipped from his hiding place and made his way toward the valley's edge opposite from the hunters' position. His enhanced senses remained fixed on their location, tracking their movements and energy fluctuations to time his own retreat.

He had nearly reached the boundary when a sound stopped him—a crystalline chime that resonated through the valley. The hunters reacted immediately, their formation tightening as they turned toward the source.

The Hollow Woman stood atop the pavilion, her darkness stark against the crystalline structure. She made no attempt at concealment, her void nature fully visible to the hunters' specialized senses.

"The White Lotus Temple sends its dogs into my territory," she said, her echoing voice carrying clearly. "How nostalgic. It's been, what, seventy years since your last failed attempt to 'purify' me?"

The leader stepped forward, jade compass raised defensively. "The Hollow Woman. We thought you had finally faded."

"Disappointed?" Her form shifted, darkness flowing like liquid. "I endure, as does the truth your Conclave tries so desperately to erase."

The hunters spread out, clearly preparing for combat. The silver-sword woman's blade began to glow with intensified purification energy. "You've violated the Containment Accord by accessing the crystal pavilion. The corrupted knowledge within was sealed for good reason."

The Hollow Woman's laugh echoed unnaturally. "I violated nothing. The pavilion opened itself to one who could read its wisdom. I merely observed, as is my right in these Wastes."

"Where is the rootless one?" the leader demanded. "We know he survived. We know he's been here."

"Do you?" Her form expanded, darkness spreading outward like wings. "Then you know more than I. Perhaps you should continue your search... elsewhere."

With these words, she gestured sharply. The crystals throughout the valley responded, vibrating at increasing frequency until they emitted a sound that pierced through Wei Liang's enhanced senses like physical pain. The hunters clutched their heads, their formation breaking as the sound disrupted their concentration.

The Hollow Woman flowed from the pavilion's top directly toward Wei Liang's position, moving faster than seemed possible. As she reached him, her darkness enveloped him completely, and the world shifted around them.

When the darkness receded, they stood in a different part of the Wastes entirely—a region where reality seemed more stable, the corruption less obvious but more deeply ingrained. The crystal valley was nowhere in sight.

"Displacement technique," the Hollow Woman explained, her form settling back into its usual state. "Useful for avoiding unwanted attention."

Wei Liang steadied himself, the sudden transition having disoriented his senses. "You came back."

"Obviously." Her tone suggested this shouldn't have been surprising. "The White Lotus hunters are dangerous, especially to one newly walking the Path. Their purification techniques could have reverted your transformation, returned you to your rootless state."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with a chill. To lose what he had gained, to return to powerlessness after tasting its opposite—the thought was more terrifying than any threat of death.

"Thank you," he said simply.

The Hollow Woman's form shifted in what might have been a shrug. "Self-interest, nothing more. A new disciple of the Path is rare enough to be worth preserving, at least until I determine whether you're more useful or dangerous."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment without offense. In the Wastes, as in the cultivation world, power and utility determined one's treatment. At least the Hollow Woman was honest about her calculations.

"The hunters knew about me specifically," he said. "They feared the combination of rootlessness and the Forgotten Path. Why?"

The darkness of her form seemed to deepen, becoming more absolute. "Because rootless individuals who walk the Path have unique... potential. Traditional cultivators are limited by their spirit roots—their nature is fixed from birth, their path predetermined. Even when they find the Forgotten Path, this limitation remains, constraining what they can become."

She moved closer, her void presence cool against his senses. "But the rootless have no such constraint. No predetermined nature. You are empty vessels from the beginning, capable of being filled with... anything."

Wei Liang considered this. "The inscriptions mentioned the Nameless—the final stage where vessel and void become indistinguishable."

"Yes." Her voice grew softer, more distant. "For most who walk the Path, the Nameless is a metaphor—they become something other than human, but still limited by their original nature. For the rootless, however..."

She didn't finish the thought, but Wei Liang understood the implication. Without a spirit root to define his fundamental nature, his transformation had fewer boundaries, fewer limitations. The emptiness that had been his greatest weakness now offered potential beyond what normal cultivators could achieve—even those who found the Forgotten Path.

"Is that why you're helping me?" he asked. "To see what I might become?"

"Curiosity is one of the few pleasures remaining to me after centuries of existence," she admitted. "And yes, I wish to see if you can avoid the fate of the last rootless one who walked this path."

"What happened to them?"

The Hollow Woman was silent for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice held an emotion Wei Liang couldn't identify—something between regret and fear.

"He became something even the Wastes couldn't contain. Something that required the combined might of every major sect to seal away." Her form contracted slightly, darkness condensing. "The cataclysm that created these Wastes? It wasn't just the forgotten gods fighting among themselves. It was also their attempt to contain what one rootless cultivator became after reaching the Nameless stage."

Wei Liang stared at her, the implications staggering. "A single cultivator caused... this?" He gestured at the broken reality around them.

"Not caused. Necessitated." She turned away, her form flowing rather than stepping. "Come. We should put more distance between ourselves and the hunters before continuing your training. They'll track us eventually—White Lotus specialists are persistent—but we can delay that reckoning."

As they moved through the more stable region of the Wastes, Wei Liang processed what he had learned. The Forgotten Path offered him power beyond what he had imagined, but at risks equally beyond his initial understanding. The hunters' fear made more sense now—they weren't merely concerned about corruption, but about the possibility of history repeating itself.

"If the rootless have such potential on this path," he asked as they traveled, "why aren't we hunted to extinction? Why allow any of us to live at all?"

"Because you're exceedingly rare," the Hollow Woman replied. "And because most rootless individuals never discover their potential. They live and die as servants, laborers, beggars—invisible to the cultivation world except as occasional tools. The sects consider it simpler to ignore you than to systematically eliminate you."

She paused, her form turning toward him. "Though some sects do quietly dispose of rootless children born within their territories. A precaution against precisely what you're becoming."

The casual mention of such atrocity didn't surprise Wei Liang. The cultivation world's brutality toward those deemed worthless was something he had experienced firsthand. That it extended to infanticide was merely the logical conclusion of a system built on power as the sole measure of value.

"And the Azure Peaks Sect?" he asked. "They kept me despite knowing I was rootless."

"An interesting question." The Hollow Woman resumed moving. "Perhaps they're more enlightened than most. Or perhaps they had other reasons for keeping you close. Reasons worth investigating, once you've grown stronger."

They continued in silence after that, Wei Liang contemplating the implications of his new knowledge while remaining alert for signs of pursuit. The Hollow Woman led him through increasingly unfamiliar territory—regions of the Wastes where corruption manifested in subtle, almost beautiful ways. Flowers that bloomed with geometric perfection. Streams that flowed in perfect circles. Birds whose songs created visible patterns in the air.

Eventually they reached a clearing where a single massive tree stood, its trunk and branches formed from what appeared to be jade rather than wood. Its leaves were thin slices of crystal that chimed softly in the perpetual twilight breeze.

"We'll rest here," the Hollow Woman said. "The Tree of Resonance masks spiritual signatures. Even White Lotus hunters will struggle to detect us in its vicinity."

Wei Liang approached the tree with cautious fascination. His enhanced senses perceived complex energy patterns flowing through its jade-like structure—not corruption exactly, but a different form of power altogether.

"What is it?" he asked.

"A remnant, like the pavilion. A living artifact from before the cataclysm." She settled at the tree's base, her darkness seeming to blend with the shadows cast by its crystalline canopy. "It grows at the boundary between corrupted and uncorrupted reality, drawing sustenance from both."

Wei Liang sat across from her, his back against the jade trunk. The contact sent a pleasant vibration through his transformed body, a resonance that seemed to stabilize the emptiness within him, making the hunger temporarily less insistent.

"You've learned much today," the Hollow Woman observed. "Perhaps too much, too quickly. The Path is not meant to be rushed."

"I don't have the luxury of time," Wei Liang replied. "The hunters know about me now. They'll report to their Conclave, which will inform the major sects. The Azure Peaks will realize I survived, that I've changed. They'll send more than search parties next time."

"True." Her form shifted, darkness flowing into a more defined shape—almost human in outline, though still featureless. "But power sought in haste is often power misused. The Forgotten Path punishes impatience more severely than most cultivation methods."

Wei Liang acknowledged the warning with a nod. "Then teach me patience along with power. Show me how to progress without losing myself to the hunger."

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely, an unusual state for her constantly shifting darkness. "An interesting request. Most who find the Path care only for advancement, for consumption, for power. Few consider the preservation of self a priority."

"I didn't survive this long by valuing power over survival," Wei Liang said. "And what use is vengeance if I'm not myself to witness it?"

A sound emerged from her darkness—something between a laugh and a sigh. "Perhaps you are different from those who came before. Very well. I will teach you what I know of balancing progression with preservation. But understand this: the Path will always demand sacrifice. The only choice is what you sacrifice, not whether you sacrifice."

Wei Liang accepted this with the pragmatism that had defined his existence. Nothing in life came without cost—this had been true when he was a servant, true when he was a rootless disciple, and remained true now that he walked the Forgotten Path. The difference was that now, for the first time, he could choose which prices he was willing to pay.

As the crystalline leaves chimed softly overhead, the Hollow Woman began her instruction—not in techniques of power, but in methods of retention. Ways to preserve memory despite the Path's erosion. Means of anchoring identity against the pull of the void. Approaches to feeding the hunger without being consumed by it.

Wei Liang absorbed these lessons with the same dedicated focus he had once applied to studying cultivation manuals he could never implement. But now, as the Hollowborn, each lesson could be immediately tested, immediately applied. His transformed nature responded to these teachings, the emptiness within him becoming more defined, more controlled, more purposeful.

In the distance, beyond perception but drawing inevitably closer, the White Lotus hunters continued their search. The Azure Peaks Sect continued its calculations. The cultivation world continued its rigid adherence to hierarchy and power.

And in the shadow of the jade tree, Wei Liang—once rootless, now Hollowborn—continued his transformation into something the cultivation world had not seen in centuries. Something they had good reason to fear.

Something that remembered.
