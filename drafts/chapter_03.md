# Chapter 3: The Betrayal

Morning in the Shattered Wastes arrived with unsettling beauty. The sun rose not from the horizon but from the center of the sky, its light fragmenting through reality distortions into prismatic beams that painted the landscape in impossible colors. Wei Liang watched the phenomenon from the edge of camp, having finished his pre-dawn duties while most of the expedition still slept.

The valley below was now clearly visible in the strange morning light. What had appeared as shimmering distortion the previous evening revealed itself as a fractured landscape—islands of earth floating at various heights, rivers that flowed in loops and spirals defying gravity, forests where each tree existed in a different season. And cutting through it all, reality fissures that appeared as jagged tears in the air itself, edges glowing with energies that hurt the eyes if observed too directly.

"Magnificent, isn't it?" 

Wei Liang turned to find one of the inner disciples standing nearby—Disciple Chen, the youngest of the inner circle and the only one who had occasionally acknowledged Wei Liang's existence without contempt. His expression now was one of scholarly fascination as he surveyed the valley.

"And terrible," Wei Liang replied quietly.

Chen glanced at him with mild surprise, perhaps not expecting a philosophical observation from a rootless disciple. "Yes. Beauty and horror intertwined. The texts say the Wastes reflect the conflict that created them—divine powers both creative and destructive unleashed without restraint."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. He had read the same texts, though he wasn't supposed to have access to them. The divine war had been a cataclysm beyond mortal comprehension, fought with weapons that targeted reality itself. The forgotten gods had fallen or transcended, but their battlefield remained—a wound in the world that refused to heal.

"We enter within the hour," Chen said after a moment. "Senior Brother Feng has identified a path to the target location that should minimize exposure to major fissures."

"Should," Wei Liang repeated, the word carrying the weight of its uncertainty.

Chen's mouth quirked in what might have been the ghost of a smile. "Indeed. The Wastes are nothing if not unpredictable." He turned to leave, then paused. "Stay alert today, Wei Liang. The deeper we go, the more dangerous the journey becomes—for all of us."

The warning—or was it advice?—was unexpected. Wei Liang inclined his head in acknowledgment, and Chen returned to the center of camp where the inner disciples were gathering.

The expedition prepared with methodical efficiency, breaking down the camp and organizing equipment for the descent into the valley. Wei Liang was assigned to carry additional protective talismans and emergency supplies—items that would be needed if things went wrong, making him simultaneously burden-bearer and safeguard.

Feng Zhao addressed the group before they departed, his expression severe. "We enter the true Wastes now. Reality here is unstable and hostile. Maintain formation at all times. Outer disciples will establish a base camp at the first stable location we find. Inner disciples will continue to the target site. Expected return is before nightfall."

His gaze swept over the assembled disciples, lingering briefly on Wei Liang. "Any sign of corruption or instability in any expedition member is to be reported immediately. The Wastes affect minds as well as bodies. Confusion, memory lapses, or unusual behavior could indicate corruption."

The implication was clear—they would leave behind anyone who became a liability. Wei Liang absorbed this information without changing his expression. It was nothing more than he had expected.

They descended into the valley along a narrow path that wound between reality distortions. Feng Zhao led, using a specialized compass that detected stability rather than direction. Wei Liang was positioned in the middle of the formation this time, surrounded by other outer disciples—not out of concern for his safety, he knew, but to ensure the emergency supplies he carried remained accessible.

The air changed as they entered the valley proper, becoming thicker and somehow textured, as if each breath had to be pulled through layers of invisible resistance. Sounds behaved strangely, sometimes reaching the ear long after their source had moved on, other times arriving before the event that caused them. Wei Liang found himself hearing footsteps before they fell, voices before lips moved.

He focused on his breathing, using the techniques he had practiced for years to center himself. The Wastes might distort external reality, but his internal discipline remained a constant he could rely on.

The path led them through a forest of crystalline trees that chimed softly when the wind blew, each note sustaining longer than natural acoustics should allow. The ground beneath their feet occasionally rippled like water, though it remained solid enough to walk on. Overhead, birds with geometrically perfect plumage flew in formations that seemed to leave afterimages in the air.

They encountered their first major obstacle at a river that flowed in a vertical loop, water rushing upward against gravity before curving and falling back to the ground in a perpetual cycle. The only crossing point was a bridge of stone that phased in and out of existence at irregular intervals.

Feng Zhao studied the pattern for several minutes before turning to the expedition. "We'll cross in pairs, timing the bridge's manifestation. Inner disciples first to secure the far side, then outer disciples with essential supplies."

The crossing proceeded as ordered, disciples waiting for Feng Zhao's signal before sprinting across the temporarily solid bridge. Wei Liang watched carefully, noting how the bridge's manifestation cycle was gradually shortening—a detail he suspected Feng Zhao had also observed, explaining the increasing urgency of his commands.

When Wei Liang's turn came, the bridge was visible for barely five seconds at a time. He waited for Feng Zhao's signal, then ran, his feet pounding against stone that felt increasingly insubstantial with each step. The bridge began to fade as he reached the halfway point, edges dissolving into mist.

Wei Liang pushed himself harder, lungs burning as he sprinted the final distance. The stone beneath his final step had already half-vanished, providing minimal purchase. He leapt the last few feet, landing heavily on the far bank as the bridge disappeared completely behind him.

"Cutting it close, rootless," Feng Zhao remarked, his tone suggesting he wouldn't have been particularly troubled if Wei Liang had fallen.

Wei Liang straightened, adjusting the packs he carried. "This disciple apologizes for the delay."

Feng Zhao's eyes narrowed slightly at the formal response, perhaps searching for hidden insolence. Finding none in Wei Liang's carefully neutral expression, he turned away to oversee the remaining crossings.

They continued deeper into the Wastes, the corruption of reality growing more pronounced with each mile. Gravity became inconsistent—stronger in some places, weaker in others. Light bent around objects in impossible ways, creating shadows that moved independently of their sources. The very ground seemed uncertain of its nature, sometimes hard as stone, other times yielding like moss regardless of its appearance.

By midday, they reached a relatively stable area where Feng Zhao ordered the base camp established. It was a circular clearing surrounded by twisted trees whose branches grew inward rather than outward, creating a natural barrier. The ground here maintained consistent properties, and the air was clearer than in the surrounding areas.

"Outer disciples will remain here and establish defensive formations," Feng Zhao announced. "Inner disciples will continue to the target location, approximately two hours from this position."

He designated one of the senior outer disciples as camp leader, then selected three others to accompany the inner disciples as porters. To Wei Liang's carefully concealed surprise, he was among those chosen.

"You'll carry the containment vessel," Feng Zhao told him, indicating an ornate box crafted from multiple materials—wood, metal, water crystal, and stone segments fitted together in complex patterns. "It's designed to safely transport the artifact. Do not open it under any circumstances."

Wei Liang accepted the vessel with a bow, securing it in a specialized harness that distributed its considerable weight across his shoulders and back. The construction was fascinating—each material segment positioned to balance and contain different energy types, with formation arrays carved into the surfaces in script so ancient he could only recognize fragments.

As the inner disciples prepared to depart, Liu Mei approached Wei Liang, ostensibly checking the supplies he carried. Under the pretense of adjusting a strap, she spoke quietly.

"The vessel you're carrying—it's designed for corrupted artifacts. Be careful. If the artifact is activated, the vessel will seal automatically, trapping anything in contact with it."

Wei Liang gave a nearly imperceptible nod to indicate he understood. "Thank you."

Liu Mei stepped back, her expression professionally neutral once more. "The medicinal paste should last through today. Apply again if you feel strain returning."

She returned to her assigned duties, leaving Wei Liang to contemplate her warning. The containment vessel was both protection and potential trap—useful information that Feng Zhao had not bothered to share with the expendable porter assigned to carry it.

The reduced expedition departed the base camp, following a path that grew increasingly difficult to discern. The inner disciples used spiritual energy to maintain their footing on terrain that shifted between solid, liquid, and gaseous states without warning. The three outer disciples, including Wei Liang, struggled to keep pace, occasionally slipping or sinking before being impatiently assisted by their superiors.

They passed through areas where time itself seemed damaged. In one clearing, they observed a fallen tree simultaneously rotting into soil and growing from a sapling, its entire lifecycle visible at once. In another, they walked through a zone where their movements left persistent afterimages that faded only gradually, creating a forest of ghost-selves that mimicked their actions with decreasing fidelity.

Throughout the journey, Wei Liang maintained his focus on the immediate task, carefully managing his energy and attention. The Wastes presented constant distractions—whispers that seemed to come from nowhere, visions at the corner of the eye, sensations that couldn't possibly be real. He recognized these as the mental effects Feng Zhao had warned about, the Wastes attempting to corrupt not just body but mind.

After nearly two hours of increasingly difficult travel, they reached their destination—a crater-like depression in the landscape, at the center of which stood the remains of a massive formation array. Stone pillars arranged in concentric circles surrounded a central platform, each carved with symbols that glowed with faint, pulsing light. The entire structure was partially translucent, as if existing simultaneously in multiple reality layers.

Feng Zhao raised his hand, signaling a halt at the crater's edge. "We've arrived. The control node should be at the array's center. Inner disciples will approach in formation. Porters remain here until called."

The inner disciples arranged themselves in a hexagonal pattern and began their careful descent into the crater, spiritual energy visibly circulating between them to maintain a protective barrier. Wei Liang and the other two porters watched from above, the containment vessel a heavy presence on Wei Liang's back.

As the inner disciples reached the first ring of pillars, the array responded. The glowing symbols brightened, and a low hum filled the air, more felt than heard. The ground within the crater began to shimmer, reality becoming even less stable than in the surrounding Wastes.

Wei Liang observed with careful attention, noting how the inner disciples adjusted their formation to counter the array's effects. Feng Zhao led them in a specific pattern, moving from pillar to pillar in what appeared to be a predetermined sequence. Each correct step caused certain symbols to dim while others brightened, gradually opening a path to the center.

It was, Wei Liang realized, a lock—an ancient security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to whatever lay at the array's heart. Feng Zhao must have obtained the correct sequence from Elder Shen or sect records, knowledge that would be incredibly valuable and carefully guarded.

After nearly thirty minutes of methodical progress, the inner disciples reached the central platform. From his position at the crater's edge, Wei Liang could see a pedestal at the center, upon which rested a crystalline object approximately the size of a human heart. Even at this distance, he could sense its wrongness—the way it seemed to bend light and attention around itself, the eye sliding away unless forced to focus.

Feng Zhao gestured, and one of the inner disciples produced a set of specialized tools. Working with extreme caution, they began to disconnect the object from the pedestal, using spiritual energy to counter the occasional flares of power that erupted from the connection points.

"What exactly is that thing?" whispered one of the other porters, his voice tight with apprehension.

"A control node," replied the third porter, an older disciple with more experience. "Part of the array's core. The texts say these ancient arrays could manipulate reality itself—create pocket dimensions, alter fundamental laws within their influence radius."

"And we're taking it back to the sect?" The first porter sounded incredulous. "It's clearly corrupted."

"Elder Shen believes it can be purified and studied," the older disciple said, though his tone suggested personal doubts. "The cultivation insights from before the divine war are worth the risk."

Wei Liang kept his thoughts to himself, but inwardly he agreed with the first porter's concern. The object radiated wrongness in a way that transcended mere corruption. It felt... hungry, somehow. Aware. The containment vessel on his back seemed to grow heavier, as if responding to the proximity of what it was designed to hold.

Below, the inner disciples completed their work. The crystalline node detached from the pedestal with a sound like shattering glass that somehow reversed itself, fragments flying together rather than apart. Feng Zhao quickly encased it in a temporary spiritual barrier, his expression tense with concentration.

The moment the node separated from the pedestal, the entire array began to change. The glowing symbols flared brightly, then started to shift and rearrange themselves. The hum intensified, becoming a discordant vibration that set teeth on edge and made vision blur.

"The array is destabilizing," Feng Zhao called out, his voice carrying to the crater's edge. "We need to leave immediately. Wei Liang, bring the containment vessel down. The rest of you prepare for immediate departure."

Wei Liang didn't hesitate. He made his way down the crater's slope, careful to follow the exact path the inner disciples had taken. The ground beneath his feet felt increasingly insubstantial, as if reality itself was thinning in response to the array's destabilization.

When he reached the inner disciples, Feng Zhao was maintaining the temporary barrier around the node with visible effort. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his hands trembled slightly from the strain.

"Open the vessel," he commanded.

Wei Liang removed the containment vessel from his back and placed it on the ground, releasing the complex series of locks that held it closed. The lid rose with a hiss of escaping pressure, revealing an interior lined with the same materials as the exterior, formation arrays continuing seamlessly inside.

Feng Zhao carefully maneuvered the node toward the open vessel, his spiritual barrier contracting gradually to guide the object into its new container. As the node descended into the vessel, Wei Liang felt a sudden spike of wrongness—the hunger he had sensed earlier intensifying dramatically.

The node touched the bottom of the vessel, and several things happened simultaneously. The array's destabilization accelerated, pillars beginning to phase in and out of reality. A shock wave of corrupted energy burst from the node, disrupting Feng Zhao's spiritual barrier. And most alarmingly, tendrils of crystalline material shot from the node toward the vessel's opening, as if the object was attempting to prevent its containment.

Wei Liang reacted instinctively, slamming the vessel's lid closed before the tendrils could escape. The locks engaged automatically with a series of metallic clicks, and the vessel's formation arrays activated, glowing with power as they contained the node's influence.

"We need to move," Feng Zhao shouted, already backing toward the array's edge. "The entire structure is collapsing!"

The inner disciples retreated in formation, maintaining their protective barrier as reality around them began to fracture more severely. Wei Liang secured the containment vessel to his back once more and followed, the weight now seeming to pulse against his spine like a second heartbeat.

They had nearly reached the first ring of pillars when the array's destabilization reached critical point. A pillar directly in their path phased out of existence, then reappeared in a different position, blocking their carefully plotted exit route.

"Alternative path," Feng Zhao ordered, redirecting the formation toward a different gap between pillars.

They adjusted course, but the array's deterioration was accelerating. Pillars blinked in and out of reality randomly, while the ground beneath them rippled like the surface of a pond. The protective formation around the inner disciples flickered as they struggled to maintain it against the chaotic energies now filling the crater.

Wei Liang focused entirely on keeping his footing and staying within the protective formation's boundary. The vessel on his back grew increasingly active, vibrating against his spine and occasionally emitting high-pitched tones that seemed to interact with the array's destabilization in unpredictable ways.

They were halfway to the crater's edge when disaster struck. A reality fissure opened directly in their path, a vertical tear in the air that revealed glimpses of somewhere else—a void filled with crystalline structures similar to the node they had retrieved. The formation faltered as the inner disciples attempted to adjust their course again.

In that moment of vulnerability, the array released a pulse of energy that swept across the crater like a physical wave. The inner disciples' formation shattered, spiritual connections between them severing as they were thrown in different directions.

Wei Liang was knocked off his feet, the containment vessel's weight driving him hard into the ground. He felt something crack in his chest, pain flaring with each breath. Around him, the other disciples were similarly affected, struggling to regain their footing on ground that now undulated like a living thing.

"Regroup!" Feng Zhao shouted, already pulling himself upright. "Reform the protective barrier!"

The inner disciples staggered toward each other, attempting to reestablish their formation. Wei Liang pushed himself to his knees, then to his feet, ignoring the stabbing pain in his chest. The containment vessel felt heavier than ever, the node inside seeming to pull at him from multiple directions simultaneously.

Another reality fissure opened, then another. The crater was becoming a maze of tears in reality, each offering glimpses of impossible elsewhere. The ground continued to shift, sections rising while others fell, creating a chaotic landscape that changed by the second.

Wei Liang saw Feng Zhao looking back at him, calculating. In that moment, he knew with absolute certainty what was about to happen. He had seen that expression before—the cold assessment of value versus cost, of necessary sacrifice.

"The vessel is destabilizing the array further," Feng Zhao called to the other inner disciples. "We need to move now, before we're trapped."

One of the other inner disciples glanced at Wei Liang, then back to Feng Zhao. "What about the porters?"

"They'll follow as they can," Feng Zhao replied, his tone making it clear that their fate was secondary. "The artifact must be protected."

Wei Liang watched as the inner disciples reformed their protective barrier, now positioned between themselves and the increasingly chaotic center of the array rather than surrounding their entire group. The meaning was clear—they would protect themselves and their retreat path, leaving the porters to fend for themselves.

The other two porters realized their situation at the same moment, their expressions shifting from confusion to fear to desperate determination. They began moving toward the inner disciples, hoping to stay close enough to benefit from the partial protection of their barrier.

Wei Liang made the same calculation but reached a different conclusion. The inner disciples were moving too quickly, prioritizing their own escape. The barrier would not extend to protect the porters, regardless of how closely they followed. And with the containment vessel on his back, he was the slowest of the three.

Instead, he changed direction, moving laterally across the crater toward a section where the reality fissures were less concentrated. If he couldn't follow the inner disciples' path, he would find his own way out.

Behind him, he heard a cry. Glancing back, he saw one of the other porters caught in a reality distortion, his body stretching and compressing in ways that human flesh was never meant to endure. The second porter had nearly reached the inner disciples when a fissure opened directly in his path. He vanished mid-step, not falling into the fissure but simply ceasing to exist in this reality, perhaps shifted to whatever lay on the other side.

Wei Liang turned away, focusing entirely on his own survival. The pain in his chest made each breath a struggle, and the containment vessel's weight threatened to unbalance him with every step. But he had spent his life being overlooked and underestimated, learning to survive in the margins. If anyone could find a path through this chaos, it was him.

He skirted the edge of a reality distortion, feeling the pull of it against his skin like a strong current. The ground beneath his feet solidified briefly, giving him a moment to assess his surroundings. The crater's edge was still distant, but he could see a potential path—a ridge of relatively stable ground that wound between the worst of the fissures.

Wei Liang began to follow this path, moving as quickly as his injured body and heavy burden allowed. Behind him, he could hear the sounds of the array's continued collapse—stone grinding against stone, the crystalline tone of reality fracturing, the distant shouts of the inner disciples as they fought their way toward the crater's edge.

He had nearly reached a promising section of the ridge when he heard footsteps approaching rapidly from behind. Turning, he saw Feng Zhao running toward him, face contorted with anger and fear. The other inner disciples were nowhere to be seen.

"Give me the vessel," Feng Zhao demanded as he reached Wei Liang, his hand already extended. "The others have cleared a path to the edge. This is our only chance."

Wei Liang began to unsling the containment vessel, his movements slowed by pain and caution. As he lifted it from his shoulders, a massive tremor shook the crater. A fissure opened nearby, larger than any before, reality peeling back to reveal a void filled with shifting colors and half-formed shapes.

The ground beneath them tilted suddenly, sending both disciples sliding toward the fissure. Wei Liang managed to catch himself on an outcropping of stone, the containment vessel clutched against his chest. Feng Zhao was less fortunate, sliding several feet before catching himself, now precariously positioned between Wei Liang and the expanding fissure.

For a moment, they stared at each other across the intervening space—the rootless disciple and the cultivation prodigy, their positions suddenly, temporarily equalized by circumstance.

"Throw me the vessel," Feng Zhao called, his voice tight with urgency. "I can get it out safely."

Wei Liang hesitated, assessing the situation with the clarity of someone who had spent his life watching for threats. Feng Zhao's position was unstable, the ground beneath him continuing to shift toward the fissure. The distance between them was significant, making any throw risky. And most tellingly, Feng Zhao's eyes held not just urgency but calculation—the same look Wei Liang had seen when he was selected for this expedition.

"I can make it to the edge with the vessel," Wei Liang replied, already beginning to move along his identified path. "Follow if you can."

Feng Zhao's expression transformed, shock giving way to fury. "You dare? You rootless nothing! That vessel belongs to the sect!"

"And I will return it to the sect," Wei Liang said, continuing his careful movement along the ridge. "If you wish to ensure that happens, help me reach the edge."

For a moment, it seemed Feng Zhao might actually consider cooperation. Then his expression hardened, and he reached for his wooden sword. "You leave me no choice."

Wei Liang had anticipated this response. In Feng Zhao's mind, a rootless disciple refusing an order was unforgivable, regardless of circumstance. He would rather risk the vessel than allow such defiance to stand.

Before Feng Zhao could fully draw his sword, another tremor shook the crater. The ground beneath him gave way completely, and he began to slide directly toward the fissure. His face transformed from anger to terror as he scrabbled for purchase on the disintegrating ground.

Wei Liang had a split-second decision to make. He could attempt to help Feng Zhao, likely resulting in both of them falling into the fissure. Or he could continue along his path, using this moment to escape while Feng Zhao was occupied with his own survival.

The choice was made for him when Feng Zhao, in his desperation, directed a spiritual attack toward Wei Liang—a last attempt to stop him from escaping with the vessel. The green energy of his wood element technique lashed out like a whip, aiming not for Wei Liang directly but for the stone outcropping that provided his stability.

The attack struck true, shattering the outcropping and sending Wei Liang tumbling down the slope. The containment vessel slipped from his grasp, sliding several feet away before coming to rest against a section of broken pillar.

Wei Liang and Feng Zhao locked eyes across the chaotic landscape, both now in equally precarious positions. In that moment of shared peril, Wei Liang saw something unexpected in Feng Zhao's expression—not just fear or anger, but a flicker of recognition. For perhaps the first time, the inner disciple was seeing him not as a rootless nothing but as another person fighting for survival.

The moment passed as quickly as it had come. Feng Zhao turned his attention to saving himself, using his spiritual energy to stabilize the ground beneath him and begin pulling himself away from the fissure's edge.

Wei Liang did the same in his own way, without spiritual energy to aid him. He dug his fingers into the unstable ground, ignoring the pain as stones cut into his flesh. With agonizing slowness, he pulled himself toward the containment vessel, every movement a battle against gravity and the crater's continuing collapse.

He had nearly reached the vessel when he heard a shout of triumph. Feng Zhao had managed to reach a more stable section and was now making his way toward the vessel as well, his movements enhanced by spiritual energy.

It would be a race, and one Wei Liang could not win. Without cultivation, he could not match Feng Zhao's speed or strength. The inner disciple would reach the vessel first, claim it, and leave Wei Liang behind to die in the collapsing array.

Unless...

Wei Liang changed direction, no longer moving toward the vessel but toward a nearby reality fissure—smaller than the one that had nearly claimed Feng Zhao, but still a tear in the fabric of existence. He positioned himself between this fissure and the vessel, then called out.

"Feng Zhao! The vessel is yours if you can claim it!"

The inner disciple's head snapped up, eyes narrowing at Wei Liang's apparent surrender. He altered his course slightly, moving more directly toward the containment vessel, his focus entirely on his prize.

Wei Liang waited until Feng Zhao was fully committed to his approach, then acted. With all his remaining strength, he slammed his fist into the ground at a specific point—a stress fracture he had identified in the crater's surface, where reality seemed thinnest.

The effect was immediate and catastrophic. The fracture expanded explosively, connecting with the nearby fissure and causing it to widen dramatically. The ground between Feng Zhao and the vessel collapsed, creating a chasm that opened directly into the reality tear.

Feng Zhao's momentum carried him forward into empty space. His expression transformed from triumph to disbelief as he began to fall. In the last moment before the fissure claimed him, he lashed out with spiritual energy, a desperate attack aimed at Wei Liang.

The green energy whip caught Wei Liang across the chest, slicing through his robes and into flesh. Pain exploded through his body, driving the air from his lungs. He fell backward, blood soaking his robes, as Feng Zhao disappeared into the fissure with a final cry of rage and terror.

For several moments, Wei Liang lay on the shuddering ground, consciousness flickering as pain and blood loss threatened to overwhelm him. The array's collapse continued around him, reality breaking down in increasingly violent ways. If he remained, death was certain—either from his wounds or from the array's destruction.

With effort that sent fresh waves of agony through his body, Wei Liang rolled onto his stomach and began crawling toward the containment vessel. Each movement was torture, each breath a struggle against the damage to his chest. Blood trailed behind him, marking his path across the broken ground.

When he finally reached the vessel, he had barely enough strength to secure it to his back once more. The weight nearly drove him flat again, his injured body protesting the additional burden. But something beyond physical strength kept him moving—a determination born from a lifetime of enduring what should have broken him.

Wei Liang began the torturous journey toward the crater's edge, following the path he had identified earlier. The array's collapse had accelerated, pillars now completely detached from reality, floating and spinning in defiance of physics. The ground phased between solid and intangible, requiring careful timing for each step.

His vision began to narrow, darkness creeping in from the edges as blood loss took its toll. Still, he continued, one agonizing step after another. When he could no longer walk, he crawled. When crawling became impossible, he pulled himself forward by his fingertips, the containment vessel dragging behind him.

After what seemed like eternity, Wei Liang reached the crater's edge. He lay there, breath coming in ragged gasps, blood pooling beneath him. The containment vessel pulsed against his back, the node inside seeming to respond to his fading life force.

With the last of his strength, Wei Liang pulled himself over the edge, tumbling down the outer slope until he came to rest on relatively stable ground beyond the array's immediate influence. The sky above him shifted between day and night in rapid cycles, a visual representation of reality's damage in this place.

As consciousness began to slip away, Wei Liang became aware of a presence nearby—not physical, but a pressure against his mind. Something ancient and patient, watching him with interest. The containment vessel grew warm against his back, the node inside resonating with whatever observed him.

In his last moments of clarity, Wei Liang understood what was happening. The node had been more than a control component—it was a fragment of something sentient, something that had waited in the array since the divine war. And now, as his life ebbed away, it reached out to him.

*Empty vessel*, a voice whispered in his mind, though it used no language he recognized. *Hollow one. You who have been carved out by rejection and pain. You are suitable.*

Wei Liang tried to resist, some instinct warning him against whatever was happening. But his strength was gone, his will fading with his blood into the corrupted soil of the Shattered Wastes.

*Do not fight*, the voice continued. *You sought power. You sought recognition. I offer both, and more. All that was denied you shall be yours. All who denied you shall know your name and tremble.*

Darkness claimed the edges of Wei Liang's vision, his heartbeat slowing to a faint, erratic rhythm. In this moment between life and death, suspended in the broken reality of the Wastes, he made his final choice.

*Yes*, he thought, surrendering to the presence that reached for him. *Yes.*

The containment vessel shattered, formation arrays failing as the node inside exerted its full power. Crystalline shards pierced Wei Liang's back, but he felt no pain—only a cold rush as something ancient and terrible flowed into him through the wounds, filling the emptiness where a spirit root should have been.

His body arched, mouth opening in a silent scream as the foreign power rewrote him from within. Blood that had been flowing outward reversed direction, drawing back into his body along with the crystalline fragments, his wounds sealing not with healing but with transformation.

Above him, the chaotic sky stabilized momentarily, as if the very Wastes held their breath to witness what was occurring. Then darkness fell completely, not just over Wei Liang's vision but over the landscape itself, a void that spread outward from his transformed body.

When light returned, Wei Liang was gone. In his place lay something both more and less—a figure that resembled him in form but not in essence. Eyes that had once been human now held depths that reflected the void between stars. Skin that had been warm and alive now bore the faint translucence of fine porcelain, with hairline cracks visible beneath the surface.

The figure that had been Wei Liang sat up slowly, movements unnaturally fluid, as if joints and muscles operated according to different principles. It examined its hands with detached curiosity, turning them over to study the network of dark veins visible beneath the pale skin.

When it finally stood, the ground beneath its feet frosted over, reality itself recoiling from its touch. It looked back at the crater where the array continued its collapse, expression unreadable. Then it turned away, gaze fixing on the distant horizon where the Azure Peaks were just visible through the Wastes' distortion.

Something like a smile crossed its face—not an expression of joy, but of purpose found. Of vengeance awakened. Of power where once there had been only emptiness.

The Forgotten Path had found its disciple. And Wei Liang, the rootless nothing, had taken his first step toward becoming something the cultivation world would learn to fear.
