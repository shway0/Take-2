# Chapter 6: First Hunt

The White Lotus hunters had not given up.

Wei Liang sensed them before he saw them—six points of purifying light moving through the corrupted landscape of the Wastes like surgical knives through infected flesh. Their spiritual energy carried that distinctive resonance of purification techniques, designed to excise corruption rather than merely resist it.

Seven days had passed since his encounter with them at the crystal pavilion. Seven days of intensive training under the Hollow Woman's guidance. Seven days of growing stronger, more controlled, more deliberate in his use of the Forgotten Path's techniques.

He watched the hunters from the high ridge overlooking what the Hollow Woman called the Quiet Wastes. From this distance, they couldn't detect him, especially with the concealment technique he had now mastered. His emptiness remained hidden behind a shell of absorbed energy, presenting the spiritual signature of ordinary rock and soil rather than the void that would draw their attention.

"They're persistent," he observed as the Hollow Woman flowed up beside him, her darkness stark against the perpetual twilight.

"The White Lotus Temple trains its hunters to pursue corruption with religious fervor," she replied. "They believe the Wastes are a spiritual infection that must be contained and eventually cleansed. Your existence represents a particular threat to their worldview."

Wei Liang studied the hunters' formation. They moved differently now—more cautiously, more systematically. They had adapted their approach after their failure at the crystal pavilion.

"They're tracking us," he said. "Not just searching randomly."

"Yes." The Hollow Woman's form shifted, darkness rippling with what might have been concern. "They've likely obtained something connected to you—perhaps from the Azure Peaks Sect, or from the array site. With such a focus, their tracking techniques can pierce even the Wastes' distortions."

Wei Liang considered this. "How long before they find us?"

"Days, perhaps. Hours if we're careless." Her form contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "Which makes this an opportune moment for your next lesson."

Wei Liang turned toward her, curiosity overriding his concern about the hunters. Each lesson she had taught him had expanded his understanding of the Forgotten Path and his own transformed nature. Each had made him stronger, more capable, more comfortable in his new existence.

"What lesson?" he asked.

"Consumption," she said simply. "Direct absorption of cultivated spiritual energy."

The hunger within Wei Liang responded immediately to these words, the emptiness at his core pulsing with anticipation. Until now, he had fed it only ambient energy from the Wastes—corrupted essence that satisfied the immediate need but provided little substantial growth. The thought of consuming pure, cultivated energy directly from its source sent a shiver of both desire and apprehension through him.

"From them?" He gestured toward the distant hunters.

"No." The Hollow Woman's tone carried a sharp edge. "The White Lotus hunters are beyond your current capabilities. Their purification techniques would likely destroy you if you attempted direct consumption."

She flowed away from the ridge's edge, indicating for him to follow. "There are others in the Wastes—less dangerous prey for your first hunt."

Wei Liang followed her down the ridge's far side, away from the hunters' path. As they descended, she continued her instruction.

"The Hollowborn can consume spiritual energy in three ways," she explained. "Ambient absorption, which you've already practiced. Direct consumption from willing or unconscious sources. And forcible extraction from resistant cultivators."

They reached the base of the ridge, entering a region where the corruption manifested as subtle distortions of natural growth—trees that curved at impossible angles, grass that grew in perfect geometric patterns.

"Each method has its advantages and limitations," the Hollow Woman continued. "Ambient absorption is safest but provides minimal growth. Willing donation is efficient but rare—few cultivators would voluntarily feed the Forgotten Path. Forcible extraction provides the most substantial power but carries the greatest risk, both physical and spiritual."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with his usual focused attention. "Risk beyond the obvious?"

"Yes." Her darkness seemed to deepen. "When you forcibly consume another's cultivated energy, you don't just take their power—you take fragments of their nature, their memories, their essence. These fragments can influence your own development if you're not careful to process them properly."

This explained something Wei Liang had wondered about—why those who walked the Forgotten Path were said to lose themselves as they progressed. It wasn't just the void's influence eroding identity, but the accumulated fragments of consumed cultivators altering the consumer's nature.

"How do I process these fragments properly?" he asked.

"By maintaining clear intention," she replied. "By knowing what you wish to preserve of yourself and what you're willing to discard. By consuming with purpose rather than mere hunger."

They continued through the geometrically corrupted landscape until they reached a small valley where a stream flowed in a perfect spiral pattern. Near its center stood a simple shelter constructed from materials that didn't belong in the Wastes—ordinary wood and stone rather than the crystalline or corrupted substances that dominated the region.

"Scavengers," the Hollow Woman explained, gesturing toward the shelter. "Cultivators who enter the Wastes to collect corrupted materials for sale to alchemists and artifact crafters. They operate in the boundary regions where corruption is mild enough to permit extended stays without protection."

Wei Liang extended his senses toward the shelter. Three cultivators inside—all at the Foundation Establishment realm, their spiritual energy modest but well-structured. Not sect disciples but independent practitioners, judging by the unaligned nature of their cultivation.

"Why haven't the White Lotus hunters found them?" he asked.

"The hunters focus on corruption threats, not minor scavenging operations," she replied. "These cultivators are careful to avoid deeper corruption and take only what can be safely transported out of the Wastes. They represent no threat to the containment of the Wastes' influence."

Wei Liang studied the scavengers' spiritual signatures more carefully. Their energy patterns were stable but showed signs of prolonged exposure to mild corruption—small distortions that wouldn't be noticeable outside the Wastes but were clear to his enhanced perception.

"They're already partially corrupted," he observed.

"Yes. It makes them suitable prey for your first consumption." The Hollow Woman's form settled into stillness. "Their energy will be easier to process than that of pure cultivators, and the cultivation world will not miss them should you... miscalculate."

The cold pragmatism of her assessment didn't disturb Wei Liang. His years at the Azure Peaks Sect had taught him that the cultivation world assigned value to individuals based solely on their power and connections. These independent scavengers, operating in the margins of society, would indeed go unmissed if they disappeared.

"How should I approach them?" he asked, already analyzing potential strategies.

"Directly," she said, surprising him. "Present yourself as a lost disciple. Their greed will do the rest."

Wei Liang considered this approach. It had merit—scavengers would see a lone disciple as an opportunity rather than a threat. They might attempt to rob him, or perhaps offer false assistance while leading him into a trap. Either way, it would bring them close enough for him to act.

"And when they're close enough?" he asked.

"You'll know," she replied, her voice carrying a hint of something like anticipation. "The hunger will guide you. Just remember—maintain your intention throughout. Consume with purpose, not merely appetite."

With these final instructions, the Hollow Woman flowed backward, her darkness merging with the shadows at the valley's edge. "I will observe, but not intervene unless absolutely necessary. This hunt is yours to complete or fail."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting both the responsibility and the implicit test. He adjusted his concealment technique, modifying the shell of energy around his core emptiness to present not as natural elements but as a cultivator in distress—spiritual energy fluctuating in patterns that suggested injury and exhaustion.

He tore his outer robe strategically, adding physical evidence to support his deception. A smear of soil across his face, a slight limp to his gait, and his disguise was complete—a sect disciple separated from his companions, lost and vulnerable in the Wastes.

Wei Liang approached the scavengers' shelter from the most visible direction, making no attempt to hide his presence. He allowed his footsteps to be heard, his labored breathing to carry on the still air. The performance wasn't entirely feigned—maintaining the specific energy shell required concentration, especially while in motion.

The shelter's door opened before he reached it. A man emerged—middle-aged, weather-worn, with the calloused hands and wary eyes of someone who lived by his wits in dangerous territory. His cultivation aura identified him as the strongest of the three inside, though still only at mid-Foundation Establishment.

"Ho there," the man called, one hand resting casually on the sword at his hip. "You're a long way from anywhere safe, young cultivator."

Wei Liang stopped a respectful distance away, swaying slightly as if struggling to remain upright. "Thank the heavens," he gasped. "I thought I might die out here. My sect brothers and I were separated during a reality fissure event. I've been wandering for days."

The man's eyes narrowed slightly, assessing Wei Liang with the practiced gaze of someone accustomed to evaluating both threats and opportunities. "Which sect?" he asked.

"Azure Peaks," Wei Liang replied, choosing the truth as the most convincing lie. He gestured at his torn robe, where the sect's cloud pattern remained visible despite the damage.

The man relaxed slightly, apparently finding the story plausible. "Feng Hu," he introduced himself with a shallow bow. "These are my Wastes-walking companions, Mei and Tao." He gestured toward the shelter, where a woman and another man now stood watching from the doorway.

"Wei Liang," he replied, using his real name without concern. If he succeeded in what he planned, there would be no one to report his survival anyway.

"Come inside," Feng Hu offered, stepping aside. "We have water and some food. You can rest before continuing your search."

Wei Liang bowed gratefully and limped toward the shelter. As he passed Feng Hu, he sensed the man's spiritual energy more clearly—decades of careful cultivation, structured and disciplined despite his rough appearance. A substantial meal for the emptiness within him.

The shelter's interior was simple but well-organized. Maps of the Wastes' boundary regions covered one wall, marked with locations of valuable materials and dangerous corruption zones. Storage containers lined another wall, presumably holding their scavenged items. A small cooking area occupied the center, where a pot of something aromatic simmered over a spirit-stone heating array.

"Sit," the woman, Mei, instructed, gesturing toward a simple bench. Her cultivation was the weakest of the three, but her spiritual energy had an unusual quality—flexible and adaptive rather than rigidly structured. "You look half-dead."

Wei Liang accepted the seat with murmured thanks. The third scavenger, Tao, handed him a cup of water, which he sipped slowly, maintaining his facade of exhaustion while observing the three with his enhanced senses.

They were cautious but not immediately hostile. Their spiritual energy remained in a neutral state—neither gathered for attack nor completely relaxed. Experienced survivors, then, neither trusting nor overtly suspicious.

"What brought Azure Peaks disciples so deep into the Wastes?" Feng Hu asked, seating himself across from Wei Liang. "You're a bit beyond your sect's usual territory."

"A recovery mission," Wei Liang replied, mixing truth and falsehood. "An artifact was detected in the inner regions. Our team was sent to retrieve it."

The three scavengers exchanged glances that confirmed Wei Liang's assessment of their nature. The mention of an artifact had sparked immediate interest—and calculation.

"Valuable artifact?" Tao asked, trying to sound casual and failing.

Wei Liang allowed a hint of sect disciple arrogance to color his response. "Valuable enough for Elder Shen to send a full team of inner disciples." He paused, then added with apparent reluctance, "And now it's lost, along with my sect brothers. Elder Shen will have my cultivation crippled for this failure."

Another exchange of glances between the scavengers. Wei Liang could practically see their thoughts—a desperate disciple, a valuable artifact, and the possibility of profit from both.

"Perhaps we could help you find your sect brothers," Feng Hu suggested, his tone carefully neutral despite the greed Wei Liang could sense in his spiritual fluctuations. "We know these regions better than most. For a reasonable finder's fee, of course."

"I have nothing to offer," Wei Liang said, injecting desperation into his voice. "Everything I carried was lost when we were separated."

Mei leaned forward, her expression sympathetic but her eyes calculating. "Your sect would surely reward those who helped return one of their disciples safely, wouldn't they? Especially if we could help locate this artifact as well."

Wei Liang pretended to consider this, as if weighing his limited options. "I... suppose they would. Elder Shen is strict but fair. If you could help me find either my sect brothers or the artifact, I'm certain she would compensate you appropriately."

Feng Hu nodded, apparently satisfied with this arrangement. "Rest tonight. Tomorrow we'll begin searching. The Wastes are dangerous to traverse without proper knowledge."

"Thank you," Wei Liang said, bowing his head in apparent gratitude. "I won't forget this kindness."

The scavengers relaxed further, their greed overriding whatever caution they might normally exercise. They began discussing search patterns and territory divisions, already planning how to maximize their chances of finding either the fictional sect brothers or the valuable artifact.

Wei Liang maintained his disguise throughout the evening, accepting a bowl of the simmering stew and listening to the scavengers' stories of their finds in the Wastes. He learned useful information about the boundary regions and the patterns of corruption, filing it away for future reference.

As night fell—or what passed for night in the perpetual twilight of the Wastes—the scavengers prepared for sleep. They arranged simple bedrolls around the shelter's perimeter, positioning Wei Liang nearest the door in a show of hospitality that was likely meant to prevent him from accessing their stored scavenged materials.

"Rest well," Feng Hu said as he settled onto his own bedroll. "Tomorrow will require strength and focus."

Wei Liang nodded, lying down and feigning immediate exhaustion. He regulated his breathing to mimic sleep while maintaining complete awareness through his enhanced senses. The scavengers remained awake for some time, conversing in whispers they thought too quiet for him to hear.

"...could ransom him back to the sect," Tao suggested.

"Fool," Mei hissed. "Azure Peaks doesn't negotiate with scavengers. They'd send cultivators to retrieve him and punish us."

"The artifact is the real prize," Feng Hu decided. "We help him search, but we find it first. Then we can decide whether to return him or not."

Wei Liang listened to their plotting with cold amusement. Their petty schemes seemed almost childish compared to the fate he had planned for them. They saw him as a resource to be exploited; he saw them as sustenance to be consumed.

He waited patiently until their whispers ceased and their breathing deepened into genuine sleep. Their spiritual energy settled into the distinctive patterns of unconsciousness—still present but less structured, more vulnerable.

Wei Liang rose silently, his transformed body moving without sound across the shelter's floor. He positioned himself at the center of the triangle formed by the three sleeping scavengers, equidistant from each. Then he released the concealment technique, allowing his true nature to emerge.

The emptiness within him expanded, no longer constrained by the shell of false energy. The hunger, held in check for hours, surged forward with almost painful intensity. Wei Liang controlled it with effort, remembering the Hollow Woman's warning—consume with purpose, not merely appetite.

He focused on his intention: to absorb these cultivators' energy without taking on their nature, to grow stronger without being influenced by their essence. With this purpose firmly in mind, he extended his awareness toward the closest scavenger—Mei.

Her spiritual energy responded to his attention, fluctuating slightly even in sleep. Wei Liang reached out not with physical touch but with the emptiness itself, extending tendrils of void toward her cultivation core. The contact was delicate, almost gentle—not forcible extraction yet, but preparation for it.

Mei stirred, her subconscious sensing the intrusion despite her unconscious state. Wei Liang paused, waiting for her to settle again before continuing. When her breathing returned to its deep rhythm, he resumed his approach, void tendrils penetrating deeper toward her spiritual center.

The hunger urged him to rush, to devour her energy in one violent consumption. Wei Liang resisted, maintaining the slow, methodical approach the Hollow Woman had described during his training. Rushing would not only wake the scavengers but would make processing their energy more difficult.

When the void tendrils finally reached Mei's cultivation core, Wei Liang felt a moment of connection—a bridge between his emptiness and her energy. Through this connection, he sensed fragments of her essence: ambition tempered by pragmatism, greed balanced by survival instinct, loyalty to her companions born of necessity rather than affection.

With careful precision, Wei Liang began to draw her spiritual energy across the connection. Not in a rush, but in a steady flow—like drinking from a cup rather than upending it. The energy entered his emptiness, cool and substantial, more satisfying than the ambient corruption he had absorbed previously.

Mei's body tensed, her face contorting in discomfort though she remained asleep. Her spiritual energy resisted instinctively, trying to maintain its integrity against the drain. Wei Liang increased the pull slightly, overcoming this unconscious resistance without waking her.

As her energy flowed into him, Wei Liang processed it according to the Hollow Woman's instructions—separating pure power from the fragments of personality and memory that accompanied it. The power he directed into his core emptiness, allowing it to strengthen his transformed being. The fragments he examined briefly before discarding most, retaining only practical knowledge about the Wastes and cultivation techniques he found useful.

Mei's breathing grew labored as the drain continued. Her spiritual energy diminished steadily, her cultivation base eroding under Wei Liang's careful consumption. He monitored her condition closely, aware that taking too much would kill her rather than merely weaken her. Death would complicate his plan for the other two.

When he had consumed approximately half her spiritual energy—enough to significantly strengthen himself without immediately endangering her life—Wei Liang withdrew the void tendrils. The connection severed, leaving Mei pale and sweating but alive. Her cultivation had been reduced from early Foundation Establishment to something barely above mortal levels.

Without pausing to savor this first successful consumption, Wei Liang turned his attention to Tao. The process was repeated—the careful approach, the connection, the steady drain of energy. Tao's essence carried different fragments: resentment toward the major sects, pride in his independence, fear of the deeper Wastes. Wei Liang processed these as he had Mei's, discarding most while absorbing the pure energy into his emptiness.

By the time he finished with Tao, Wei Liang could feel the changes in his transformed body. The emptiness within him felt more substantial somehow, more defined. The crystalline structures that had begun forming throughout his flesh grew more pronounced, more complex. His senses sharpened further, allowing him to perceive spiritual energy with greater precision.

He turned finally to Feng Hu, the strongest of the three and therefore the most valuable source. As Wei Liang extended his void tendrils toward the man's cultivation core, he felt resistance even before making contact—Feng Hu's spiritual energy was better protected, more disciplined even in sleep.

Wei Liang adjusted his approach, making the tendrils thinner, more subtle, less detectable to spiritual senses. It took longer to establish the connection, requiring more precision and control, but eventually he succeeded. Feng Hu's essence revealed decades of hard-won cultivation, bitter experiences that had shaped both his techniques and his character, knowledge of the Wastes that exceeded his companions'.

The consumption process began as before, with Wei Liang drawing Feng Hu's spiritual energy in a steady, controlled flow. The man's cultivation resisted more strongly than the others', his spiritual foundations more firmly established through years of practice. Wei Liang increased the pull gradually, overcoming this resistance without triggering defensive reflexes that might wake him.

As Feng Hu's energy flowed into him, Wei Liang felt the hunger growing more insistent, demanding complete consumption rather than partial feeding. The emptiness within him, partially filled by Mei and Tao's energy, now wanted to devour Feng Hu entirely—to take not just his power but his very essence.

Wei Liang struggled to maintain his original intention. Consume with purpose, not appetite. Take what strengthens without changing your nature. He repeated these principles mentally while continuing the careful drain of Feng Hu's cultivation.

The scavenger's breathing grew increasingly labored, his face contorting in pain despite remaining unconscious. His spiritual energy fought harder against the drain as it diminished, instinctive survival mechanisms activating even without conscious direction.

Wei Liang had consumed perhaps two-thirds of Feng Hu's cultivation when the man's eyes snapped open, awareness returning despite the spiritual drain. For a moment, confusion dominated his expression—then horror as he perceived Wei Liang's true nature through spiritual senses.

"Waste-fiend!" Feng Hu gasped, his hand moving toward the sword beside his bedroll. "Corruption incarnate!"

Wei Liang didn't bother correcting this misidentification. Instead, he intensified the connection, shifting from careful consumption to forcible extraction. The void tendrils thickened, pulling Feng Hu's remaining spiritual energy in a torrent rather than a stream.

The scavenger tried to resist, attempting to gather his diminished power for a defensive technique. But with most of his cultivation already consumed, his efforts were futile. His spiritual energy continued flowing into Wei Liang's emptiness, now accompanied by fragments of conscious thought and immediate emotion—fear, rage, disbelief.

These conscious fragments were harder to process, carrying stronger imprints of Feng Hu's identity. Wei Liang struggled to separate power from essence, to consume one without absorbing the other. Some fragments slipped through his filtering, briefly imposing foreign thoughts and emotions on his consciousness before he could isolate and discard them.

Feng Hu's hand closed around his sword hilt, but he lacked the strength to draw the weapon. His cultivation nearly depleted, his physical body began to fail as well—systems dependent on spiritual energy shutting down one by one.

"What... are you?" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Wei Liang met his gaze directly, allowing the scavenger to see what he had become. "The consequence of abandonment," he replied, his voice carrying the faint echo that had developed since his transformation. "The price of betrayal."

Feng Hu's eyes widened in final understanding before the last of his spiritual energy flowed into Wei Liang's emptiness. Without cultivation to sustain his aging body, the scavenger collapsed, dead before he hit the ground.

The sudden death sent a pulse of energy through the shelter—not spiritual but something more primal, the release that accompanies a soul's departure from its vessel. This pulse disturbed the remaining scavengers' sleep, drawing them toward consciousness despite their weakened state.

Wei Liang turned toward Mei as her eyes fluttered open. Her spiritual senses, diminished but not entirely gone, registered his true nature immediately. Unlike Feng Hu, however, her reaction wasn't horror but despair—the recognition that escape was impossible.

"Please," she whispered, too weak to move from her bedroll. "Mercy."

Wei Liang considered her request dispassionately. The hunger within him was partially sated by the three consumptions, no longer demanding immediate feeding. He could spare her life without compromising his growth. The question was whether doing so served his purpose.

"What would you do with mercy if granted it?" he asked, curious despite himself.

Mei swallowed, her gaze darting to Feng Hu's lifeless form before returning to Wei Liang. "Live," she said simply. "Continue. Survive."

An honest answer, at least. No promises of redemption or change, just the basic drive to exist that had likely guided her entire life. Wei Liang respected the simplicity of it, the absence of pretense.

"Then survive," he decided, stepping away from her. "Return to the cultivation world. Tell them what you encountered in the Wastes. Describe what I've become."

Relief flooded her face, quickly followed by confusion. "You want me to warn them about you?"

"I want them to know I'm coming," Wei Liang clarified. "I want them to prepare, to gather their strength, to believe they can stop what approaches. It will make their failure more complete when it comes."

Understanding dawned in Mei's eyes, followed by a fear deeper than her earlier despair. Not fear for herself, but for the cultivation world that remained ignorant of what had awakened in the Wastes.

"Who should I tell?" she asked, her voice steadier now that immediate death no longer threatened.

"The Azure Peaks Sect," Wei Liang replied. "Tell them Wei Liang has found a new path. Tell them he remembers their betrayal. Tell them he's coming home."

Tao stirred on his bedroll, consciousness returning more slowly due to his weaker constitution. Wei Liang glanced at him briefly before returning his attention to Mei.

"Take him with you," he instructed. "Two witnesses are more convincing than one. Leave now, before I reconsider my mercy."

Mei didn't need to be told twice. Despite her weakened state, she rose shakily and moved to Tao, helping him to his feet. They gathered nothing from the shelter, abandoning their scavenged materials and supplies in their haste to escape.

At the door, Mei paused, looking back at Wei Liang with an expression he couldn't quite interpret. "What are you becoming?" she asked, the question seeming driven by genuine curiosity rather than fear.

Wei Liang considered his answer carefully. "Something forgotten," he finally said. "Something the cultivation world tried to erase from memory. Something returning to remind them of what they abandoned."

Mei nodded slowly, as if his cryptic answer confirmed some private thought. Without another word, she and Tao departed, supporting each other as they stumbled away from the shelter and the horror it contained.

Wei Liang watched them go, tracking their spiritual signatures until they passed beyond even his enhanced perception. Only then did he turn his attention inward, examining the changes wrought by his first true feeding.

The emptiness within him had evolved, developing structure within its void. The hunger remained but felt different—more focused, more patient, more purposeful. His physical form had changed as well, the crystalline alterations spreading further throughout his flesh, replacing more of his original humanity with something other.

He extended his awareness outward, testing the limits of his enhanced perception. His range had increased significantly, allowing him to sense spiritual energy at greater distances and with finer discrimination. He could detect the White Lotus hunters from his current position, still following their methodical search pattern several miles away.

"An efficient first hunt," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing through the shelter's door without opening it. "Though perhaps more merciful than I expected."

Wei Liang turned toward her, unsurprised by her sudden appearance. He had sensed her watching throughout the consumption process, her void presence distinct even when she attempted to conceal it.

"Mercy serves my purpose," he replied. "Their warnings will create anticipation, expectation. The cultivation world will prepare for a threat they think they understand."

"And they will face one beyond their comprehension," she concluded, her form shifting as she examined him. "You've changed more than I anticipated from a single feeding. The rootless truly do progress differently along this path."

Wei Liang moved to the shelter's center, where Feng Hu's body lay. The scavenger's face remained frozen in that final moment of understanding, eyes wide, mouth slightly open. Wei Liang closed those staring eyes with a gesture that might have been respect in another life.

"What stage have I reached?" he asked, sensing that his transformation had advanced beyond the basic Hollowborn state.

"You approach the threshold of Fracture," the Hollow Woman replied. "The second stage of the Forgotten Path. Your emptiness has begun to develop structure—the first sign of progression beyond mere consumption."

Wei Liang recalled the inscriptions describing this stage. Fracture involved the splintering of identity, the fragmentation of self to create space for greater power. It granted abilities beyond simple energy absorption—limited reality manipulation, spiritual interference, enhanced corruption resistance.

"How long before I cross that threshold?" he asked.

"That depends on you," she said. "On how quickly you consume, how effectively you process what you take, how purposefully you direct your transformation." Her form contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "But I would estimate days rather than weeks, given your rate of progression."

Wei Liang absorbed this assessment without visible reaction, though internally he felt a complex mixture of satisfaction and wariness. Rapid advancement meant growing power but also accelerated cost—the erosion of self that accompanied progression along the Forgotten Path.

"The White Lotus hunters will find this place soon," he observed, changing the subject. "They'll know what happened here."

"Yes," the Hollow Woman agreed. "Which means we should depart before they arrive. Their tracking abilities will be enhanced once they confirm your nature through direct evidence."

Wei Liang nodded, seeing the wisdom in this suggestion. He had no desire to confront the hunters yet, not until he had crossed the threshold into Fracture and gained a better understanding of his evolving abilities.

"Where should we go?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's form flowed toward the door. "Deeper into the Wastes. To places where even the White Lotus fears to tread. Where corruption has transformed reality so completely that their purification techniques become useless."

Wei Liang followed her outside, leaving the shelter and its single dead occupant behind. The perpetual twilight of the Wastes seemed different to his enhanced perception—richer in detail, more varied in its subtle gradations of light and shadow. The corruption that permeated everything appeared not as wrongness but as potential, as possibility unrestricted by conventional laws.

They traveled in silence for a time, moving away from the boundary regions into territories where corruption grew more pronounced. Reality fissures appeared with increasing frequency—tears in existence that connected distant locations or different aspects of the Wastes. The landscape itself became less recognizable as natural terrain, transforming into formations that defied conventional geometry.

As they walked, Wei Liang processed the energy he had consumed, integrating it more fully into his transformed being. The fragments of the scavengers' essences he had inadvertently absorbed were examined, understood, and either discarded or carefully stored away from his core identity. Their knowledge he retained—survival techniques, Wastes navigation, cultivation methods that might prove useful despite their orthodox nature.

"You maintain your sense of self well," the Hollow Woman observed after several hours of travel. "Most who walk this path struggle more with the fragments they absorb."

"I had practice before the Path," Wei Liang replied. "Years of separating what others believed me to be from what I knew myself to be. Years of preserving an inner self while presenting an outer face that satisfied expectations."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been acknowledgment. "A survival strategy that now serves a different purpose. Interesting how our pasts prepare us for futures we cannot anticipate."

They continued deeper into the Wastes, passing through regions where corruption had created beauty as often as horror—crystalline forests that sang in harmonic resonance, lakes where liquid flowed upward in perpetual fountains, fields of flowers that bloomed with mathematical precision in fractal patterns.

Eventually they reached a boundary unlike any Wei Liang had encountered before—not a physical barrier but a threshold in reality itself, visible to his enhanced perception as a shimmering curtain of energy that stretched across their path.

"The Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman announced, her form expanding slightly as they approached this boundary. "The heart of corruption, where the cataclysm's effects are most concentrated. Few enter willingly. Fewer still return unchanged, if they return at all."

Wei Liang studied the threshold with all his senses. Beyond it, corruption wasn't just present but dominant—reality itself rewoven according to principles that contradicted normal existence. The ambient energy there was denser, more potent, more fundamentally altered from its original state.

"What will we find beyond?" he asked.

"Challenges suitable for your continued growth," she replied. "Entities neither human nor spirit, but transformed by prolonged exposure to corruption. Artifacts from before the cataclysm, preserved in distorted states. Knowledge forbidden by the cultivation world for good reason."

She turned toward him, her darkness condensing until he could almost make out features within it—eyes that evaluated, a mouth that spoke with centuries of experience.

"And privacy," she added. "The White Lotus hunters will not follow us there. Their purification techniques would be not merely ineffective but actively dangerous to them in the Deep Wastes. The corruption there can invert their methods, turning purification into accelerated corruption."

Wei Liang considered the threshold and what lay beyond it. The hunger within him responded to the potent energy he sensed, eager to consume and grow stronger. But caution tempered this eagerness—the Deep Wastes clearly presented dangers as well as opportunities.

"You've been there before," he said, not a question but an observation.

"Many times," she confirmed. "It is where I retreated after turning back from the final threshold. Where I've existed for centuries, neither advancing nor retreating along the Path."

Wei Liang sensed there was more to her story—reasons for her retreat, purposes for her continued existence—but he didn't press. The Hollow Woman revealed what she chose to reveal, when she chose to reveal it. Demanding more would likely yield nothing.

"Will crossing this boundary accelerate my transformation?" he asked instead.

"Yes," she said simply. "The Deep Wastes intensify all processes, including progression along the Forgotten Path. Your advancement toward Fracture will proceed more rapidly there, perhaps more rapidly than is wise."

"Yet you suggest we go there anyway."

"Because the alternatives are worse," she replied. "Remaining in the outer Wastes means eventual confrontation with the White Lotus hunters before you're ready. Returning to the cultivation world means facing sects with resources to contain or destroy you. The Deep Wastes offer time and opportunity to grow stronger before such confrontations become necessary."

Wei Liang couldn't argue with her logic. His purpose required strength beyond what he currently possessed—strength to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, strength to reshape a system that had deemed him worthless from birth. If the Deep Wastes offered the fastest path to such strength, then the risks were acceptable.

"How do we cross?" he asked, studying the threshold's shimmering energy.

"With intention," the Hollow Woman replied. "The boundary responds to purpose. Enter with clear understanding of why you seek the Deep Wastes, and it will permit passage. Enter with confusion or fear, and it will reject you—violently."

Wei Liang focused his thoughts, clarifying his purpose. He sought the Deep Wastes for growth, for knowledge, for preparation. He sought power not as an end but as a means—a tool to force recognition from a world that had refused to see him. He sought transformation not to escape his identity but to fulfill it—to become the consequence of others' actions, the embodiment of their failure to value what they had discarded.

With this purpose firmly in mind, he stepped forward, approaching the shimmering boundary. The energy responded to his proximity, rippling like water disturbed by a stone. As he reached the threshold itself, he felt resistance—not rejection but evaluation, as if the boundary itself possessed some form of consciousness that judged those who sought passage.

For a moment, Wei Liang stood suspended between realms, his transformed body half in the outer Wastes, half in the threshold itself. The boundary energy flowed around and through him, examining his nature, his purpose, his potential. He felt it probe the emptiness within him, the hunger that drove him, the remnants of humanity that still defined his core identity.

Then, with a sensation like passing through a waterfall, he was through—standing fully in the Deep Wastes, surrounded by a reality so fundamentally altered that it defied complete comprehension even with his enhanced senses.

The Hollow Woman followed, her darkness flowing through the boundary with practiced ease. She reformed beside him, her void nature seeming more at home in this corrupted environment than in the relatively normal outer Wastes.

"Welcome," she said, "to the place the cultivation world fears above all others. The source of corruption. The heart of the cataclysm. The Deep Wastes, where reality obeys different laws and power takes forms unknown to orthodox cultivation."

Wei Liang absorbed his surroundings with all senses extended. The landscape defied conventional description—structures that might be mountains or might be frozen waves of solid energy; vegetation that grew in four dimensions, extending into spaces that shouldn't exist; a sky that displayed not stars or sun or moon but mathematical patterns that shifted according to principles he couldn't yet grasp.

The ambient energy here was thick enough to be almost visible, flowing in currents and eddies that connected everything in complex networks. Corruption wasn't a foreign element here but the fundamental nature of existence—not a distortion of reality but reality itself, operating according to its own consistent but alien logic.

"I can feel it already," Wei Liang said, sensing changes accelerating within his transformed body. The crystalline structures spread more rapidly, replacing more of his original flesh with their alien substance. The emptiness within him expanded and contracted in new rhythms, processing the dense ambient energy without conscious direction.

"Yes," the Hollow Woman acknowledged. "The Deep Wastes will accelerate your transformation. You must be vigilant to maintain control of the process rather than being controlled by it."

She led him deeper into this impossible landscape, moving along paths that seemed to form themselves in response to their passage. As they traveled, Wei Liang observed entities in the distance—shapes that suggested consciousness without conforming to any recognizable species or category. Some noticed their passage, turning sensory organs or structures that served similar purposes toward them before returning to incomprehensible activities.

"The inhabitants," the Hollow Woman explained, noticing his attention. "Some were human once, or spirit beasts, or other recognizable beings. Others formed spontaneously from the corruption itself, consciousness emerging from complexity without conventional birth or creation."

"Are they dangerous?" Wei Liang asked, tracking one particularly large entity that resembled a geometric storm more than any living creature.

"All things in the Deep Wastes are dangerous in their own ways," she replied. "But most will ignore us if we don't interfere with their territories or purposes. They recognize me, and by extension, you as under my protection. For now."

They continued until they reached a formation that resembled a mountain if mountains could fold in on themselves, creating spaces that were simultaneously interior and exterior. Within one such impossible fold, a structure stood—not a building in conventional terms, but a space defined by boundaries that suggested habitation.

"My dwelling in the Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman said, her form flowing toward the entrance. "More secure than the inverted cottage, more isolated than the jade tree. Here we can continue your training without concern for hunters or other interruptions."

Wei Liang followed her inside, finding a space that somehow felt both alien and familiar. The interior defied normal geometry, with angles that shouldn't connect forming continuous surfaces, but the basic elements of habitation remained recognizable—areas for rest, for study, for practice.

Most striking was a wall covered entirely in script similar to that from the crystal pavilion—the ancient writing that described the Forgotten Path and its stages. Here, however, the inscriptions were more extensive, more detailed, covering aspects of the Path that the pavilion had only hinted at.

"My own records," the Hollow Woman explained, noticing his interest. "Compiled over centuries of walking the Path and observing others who attempted it. More complete than the pavilion's knowledge, more accurate in some respects."

Wei Liang approached the wall, his enhanced perception allowing him to absorb the dense information more efficiently than would have been possible before his transformation. The inscriptions described techniques, progressions, warnings, and possibilities he hadn't encountered in the pavilion's more limited text.

"Study these," the Hollow Woman instructed. "Understand what awaits as you progress toward Fracture and beyond. Knowledge is your best defense against the Path's tendency to consume identity along with power."

Wei Liang nodded, already immersing himself in the ancient writing. The hunger within him had temporarily receded, satisfied by the scavengers' energy and the dense ambient power of the Deep Wastes. This allowed him to focus fully on learning, on preparation for what was to come.

As he studied, he became aware of changes continuing within his transformed body—subtle but significant alterations to his structure, his capabilities, his very nature. The emptiness at his core was evolving, developing complexity within its void. The crystalline elements throughout his flesh were forming new patterns, new connections, new functions.

He was approaching Fracture more rapidly than even the Hollow Woman had predicted. The Deep Wastes' influence, combined with his successful first consumption, had accelerated his progression dramatically. Within days, perhaps even hours, he would cross the threshold into the second stage of the Forgotten Path.

Wei Liang welcomed this acceleration. Every step along the Path brought him closer to the power he needed to fulfill his purpose—to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, to reshape a system that had deemed him worthless, to become a consequence that could not be ignored or forgotten.

In the heart of corruption, surrounded by a reality that defied conventional understanding, the once-rootless disciple continued his transformation into something the cultivation world had not seen in centuries. Something they had good reason to fear. Something that remembered betrayal and promised return.

The Forgotten Path unfolded before him, and Wei Liang walked it with purpose—not merely hunger, not merely revenge, but the focused intention to become exactly what the Azure Peaks Sect deserved for what they had done to him.

A reckoning in human form. A consequence given flesh. A memory that refused to be forgotten.
