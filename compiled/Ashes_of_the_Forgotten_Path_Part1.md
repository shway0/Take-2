# ASHES OF THE FORGOTTEN PATH

## PART I: THE BETRAYAL AND AWAKENING

# Chapter 1: The Rootless Disciple

The morning bell rang across the Azure Peaks Sect, a clear tone that rippled through the mountain valleys like a stone dropped in still water. Wei Liang was already awake. He had been for hours, kneeling in the corner of the outer disciples' dormitory, a cultivation manual open before him in the thin light of pre-dawn.

He closed the book with careful hands, sliding it beneath the loose floorboard where he kept his small collection of borrowed texts. Borrowed without permission, but he always returned them before they were missed from the sect library. The thought of being caught made his stomach tighten—not from fear of punishment, which was expected, but from the prospect of losing this small, secret defiance.

Wei Liang rose and straightened his gray outer disciple robes, the coarse fabric worn thin at the elbows and knees. Unlike the other disciples whose robes were replaced each season, his had been mended so many times that the original material was now more memory than substance. He ran his fingers through his hair, binding it in the simple knot that marked his station, and stepped out into the corridor.

The other outer disciples were stirring now, their movements unhurried. They had time. Wei Liang did not. He slipped past them, head slightly bowed, shoulders curved inward—the posture of someone trying to occupy as little space as possible. It was a habit formed over years, a physical manifestation of his place in the sect hierarchy.

Outside, the mountain air cut through his thin robes. The Azure Peaks lived up to their name this morning, their summits catching the first light of dawn in a blue-tinged glow that made the stone seem almost translucent. Beautiful, if one had time to look. Wei Liang kept his eyes on the path.

The kitchens were already busy when he arrived. Cook Liu, a broad-shouldered man with forearms thick as tree branches, nodded at Wei Liang's entrance.

"You're early," he said, not looking up from the vegetables he was chopping.

"Always," Wei Liang replied, moving to the large water barrels at the back of the kitchen.

He filled two wooden buckets and lifted them with practiced ease, one in each hand. The weight pulled at his shoulders, but he had been carrying water since he was seven years old. His body had adapted, even if his spirit had not.

"Inner disciples have a special training session today," Cook Liu said as Wei Liang turned to leave. "They'll need extra water brought to the east training ground by mid-morning."

Wei Liang nodded. "I'll see to it."

"And Wei Liang," Cook Liu added, his knife pausing momentarily, "Feng Zhao will be leading the session."

The name landed like a stone in Wei Liang's chest, but his expression remained neutral. "I understand."

He left the kitchen, water sloshing gently in the buckets as he made his way to the disciples' washing area. The sect was fully awake now, disciples of various ranks moving with purpose along the stone paths. They flowed around Wei Liang as if he were a rock in a stream, their eyes sliding past him without recognition.

It hadn't always been this way. When he first arrived at the sect gates, abandoned by parents who couldn't bear the shame of a rootless child, he had been visible in his novelty. The sect servants had taken him in—not out of compassion, but because even a rootless child could carry water and sweep floors. For years, he had been just another servant, until Master Jing's inexplicable decision three years ago.

Wei Liang reached the washing area and began filling the stone basins, his movements efficient and silent. The first outer disciples were arriving now, ignoring him as they prepared for the day. He kept his eyes down, but his ears open. Information was its own form of cultivation, one available even to the rootless.

"...expedition to the Shattered Wastes," one disciple was saying, his voice low with excitement. "Inner Disciple Feng is selecting the team himself."

"The Wastes?" another replied, skepticism clear in his tone. "What could be worth retrieving from that cursed place?"

"Something valuable enough that Elder Shen authorized the mission personally."

Wei Liang's hands stilled momentarily before resuming their work. The Shattered Wastes. Even he knew of that place—a fractured battlefield where reality itself had been damaged during the war of the forgotten gods. Few ventured there willingly, and fewer returned unchanged.

He finished filling the basins and collected his empty buckets, thoughts churning behind his carefully blank expression. An expedition to the Wastes would require support staff—people to carry equipment, set up camps, prepare meals. People considered expendable.

People like him.

Wei Liang made his way back to the kitchens for more water. The sun had fully risen now, illuminating the sect in golden light that did nothing to warm the chill that had settled in his core. He had survived twelve years in the Azure Peaks Sect by making himself useful while remaining unnoticed. The prospect of the Wastes threatened both conditions.

As he rounded a corner, a group of inner disciples approached from the opposite direction. Wei Liang immediately moved to the edge of the path, eyes lowered, but it wasn't enough. It never was, when Feng Zhao was involved.

"If it isn't our rootless disciple," Feng Zhao's voice carried the particular tone of amused disdain he reserved for Wei Liang. "Still carrying water? How appropriate for someone with no spirit root."

Wei Liang stopped and bowed, the proper depth for an outer disciple addressing an inner disciple. "This disciple greets Inner Disciple Feng."

Feng Zhao was everything Wei Liang was not. Tall and graceful, with the subtle glow of advanced cultivation emanating from his skin. His azure robes were immaculate, the silver trim marking him as not just an inner disciple but one of exceptional talent. His pure wood spirit root was the pride of the sect, a perfect vessel for cultivation that had allowed him to advance to the third level of Core Formation by age twenty-two.

He was also, Wei Liang knew, cruel in the casual way of those who had never faced consequences.

"I've been hearing interesting rumors about you, Wei Liang," Feng Zhao said, stepping closer. The other inner disciples formed a loose semicircle, their expressions ranging from boredom to anticipation. "They say you've been seen in the sect library after hours. Reading cultivation manuals, of all things."

Wei Liang's pulse quickened, but his face remained impassive. "This disciple was cleaning the library, as instructed."

"Of course you were." Feng Zhao's smile didn't reach his eyes. "And I'm sure you didn't understand a word of what you saw. What use is cultivation theory to someone who can never practice it?"

The words were familiar barbs, ones Wei Liang had heard in various forms throughout his life. He had long ago learned that there was no correct response. Denial would be called a lie; admission would be called presumption. Silence was his only defense.

Feng Zhao stepped closer, close enough that Wei Liang could smell the faint scent of wood and earth that surrounded cultivators of his element. "You know, I'm assembling a team for a special mission. Perhaps I should include you."

One of the other disciples laughed. "What use would he be?"

"Every expedition needs someone to carry the bags," Feng Zhao replied, his eyes never leaving Wei Liang's face. "And if we encounter danger... well, even a rootless disciple can serve as a distraction."

The implication was clear, and a cold weight settled in Wei Liang's stomach. He had always known his value to the sect was measured primarily in his expendability, but to hear it stated so plainly still cut deep.

"This disciple serves as the sect requires," Wei Liang said, the formal words falling from his lips automatically.

"Good." Feng Zhao's smile widened. "Report to the expedition preparation hall tomorrow morning. Don't be late."

He moved past Wei Liang, deliberately bumping his shoulder hard enough that water sloshed from the buckets. The other disciples followed, several smirking as they passed. Wei Liang remained still until they were gone, then continued on his way, his wet shoes leaving dark footprints on the stone path.

The day proceeded as most days did for Wei Liang—an endless cycle of menial tasks punctuated by brief moments of stolen study. He carried water to the training grounds, watching from the periphery as disciples practiced techniques he had memorized but could never perform. He swept the corridors of the medicine hall, listening to discussions of herbs and their properties, filing away information that might someday prove useful. He served meals in the outer disciples' dining hall, collecting scraps of gossip and news.

And through it all, the knowledge of tomorrow's assignment hung over him like a sword.

As evening approached, Wei Liang completed his final tasks and made his way to the sect library. Officially, he was there to clean. Unofficially, it was the only time he could access the cultivation manuals that had become his obsession.

The library was empty at this hour, most disciples either meditating or resting. Wei Liang moved through the familiar space with quiet efficiency, dusting shelves and straightening scrolls while his eyes scanned for anything new or useful. He had already read most of the basic manuals available to outer disciples, understanding the theory even as the practice remained forever beyond his reach.

He was replacing a scroll on wood element cultivation when a soft voice broke the silence.

"You're the one who reorganized the elemental theory section, aren't you?"

Wei Liang turned, startled. A young woman stood in the doorway, her robes marking her as a core disciple—the highest rank below the elders themselves. Her presence here, alone, at this hour, was so unexpected that for a moment Wei Liang could only stare.

He recognized her, of course. Everyone in the sect knew Yun Hua, daughter of the Sect Leader, prodigy with a pure water spirit root. She was said to have reached Core Formation at sixteen, an achievement that came along perhaps once in a generation. Wei Liang had glimpsed her occasionally from a distance, but their paths had never crossed directly.

Until now.

He dropped immediately into a deep bow. "This disciple apologizes for any presumption. The scrolls were—"

"Arranged by application rather than author," she finished for him. "It's actually much more useful this way. I've been wondering who did it."

Wei Liang straightened slowly, uncertain how to respond. Yun Hua was studying him with open curiosity, her head slightly tilted. Unlike Feng Zhao's practiced arrogance, her gaze held no malice—only interest.

"You're Wei Liang," she said. It wasn't a question. "The outer disciple Master Jing elevated from the servant ranks."

"Yes, Senior Sister," he replied, using the respectful address for a higher-ranked disciple.

"And you read cultivation manuals." Again, not a question. There was no point in denying it—she had clearly already determined the truth.

"This disciple has taken the liberty of studying the theory, though he cannot practice," Wei Liang admitted, bracing for the ridicule or reprimand that usually followed such an admission.

Instead, Yun Hua nodded thoughtfully. "Theory has its own value. My water cultivation instructor says understanding precedes ability."

The statement was so unexpected that Wei Liang momentarily forgot his careful mask of deference. "The Flowing Mind Sutra says the same. 'Knowledge is the vessel that carries practice across the river of ignorance.'"

As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted them. Quoting cultivation texts to a core disciple—he might as well have claimed to be her equal. He lowered his eyes, waiting for her anger.

"You've read the Flowing Mind Sutra?" Surprise colored her voice, but not offense. "That's restricted to core disciples and above."

Wei Liang remained silent. Any explanation would only compound his transgression.

To his shock, Yun Hua laughed softly. "Don't worry. I'm not going to report you. I'm actually impressed. That text is challenging even for those with years of cultivation experience."

She moved further into the library, her steps light and graceful. "I came here looking for information on water element applications in the Shattered Wastes. My father mentioned an expedition is being prepared."

Wei Liang's surprise must have shown on his face, because she added, "You know of it?"

"This disciple has been assigned to the expedition," he said carefully. "As support staff."

Something flickered across Yun Hua's expression—concern, perhaps. "The Wastes are dangerous, even for advanced cultivators. The reality distortions affect everyone, regardless of cultivation level."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. He knew the risks, probably better than most of those who would be going. He had read every account of the Wastes available in the sect library, memorizing the descriptions of reality fissures, corrupted spiritual energy, and the strange entities that dwelled there.

"This disciple will be careful," he said, the words hollow even to his own ears. Caution meant little when one was considered expendable.

Yun Hua seemed about to say something more when footsteps sounded in the corridor outside. Her expression changed, becoming more distant.

"I should go," she said, turning toward the door. "Thank you for your assistance with the library organization."

She paused at the threshold, looking back at him. "Wei Liang... the eastern section of the Wastes is particularly unstable. The water flows backward there, and memories can manifest physically. Remember that."

Before he could respond, she was gone, leaving Wei Liang alone with the dust motes dancing in the fading light and the strange, unexpected warmth of having been seen—truly seen—for perhaps the first time in his life.

The warmth didn't last. As darkness fell and Wei Liang made his way back to the outer disciples' dormitory, reality reasserted itself. Tomorrow he would join an expedition to one of the most dangerous places in the world, led by someone who viewed him as less than human. His chances of return were slim at best.

In the dormitory, the other disciples were already settling onto their sleeping mats. No one acknowledged Wei Liang's entrance. He made his way to his corner, the smallest space with the thinnest mat, and sat cross-legged. Sleep would not come easily tonight.

Instead, he closed his eyes and began the breathing exercises he had read about in countless cultivation manuals. He could not circulate spiritual energy—he had no spirit root to gather it—but the techniques still calmed his mind and strengthened his body in small ways.

As his breathing slowed, Wei Liang allowed himself to imagine, just for a moment, what it might be like to have been born different. To have a spirit root, to feel the world's energy responding to his call, to be valued for his potential rather than his utility.

The fantasy was a dangerous indulgence, one he rarely permitted himself. Tonight, with the Shattered Wastes looming in his future, he granted himself this small mercy.

In the darkness behind his closed eyes, Wei Liang pictured spiritual energy flowing through meridians he had memorized but never felt. He imagined the sensation of a core forming within his dantian, the power building with each breath. He visualized techniques he had studied but could never perform—the Verdant Sword Art that Feng Zhao wielded, the Flowing Water Steps that Yun Hua must know.

Reality would return with the morning bell. For now, in the privacy of his mind, Wei Liang allowed himself to cultivate the only thing truly his own—his dreams.

Outside, the moon rose over the Azure Peaks, bathing the sect in silver light that transformed the mundane into the mystical. Inside, a rootless disciple breathed in patterns that should have been meaningless to him, unaware that far away in the Shattered Wastes, something ancient stirred in response to his silent defiance.

Something that had been waiting for a vessel empty enough to receive it.



# Chapter 2: The Expedition

Dawn broke over the Azure Peaks Sect with a thin, gray light that promised rain. Wei Liang stood in the expedition preparation hall, a cavernous space normally reserved for inner disciples before important missions. He had arrived before anyone else, positioning himself near the back wall where he might go unnoticed until needed. His few possessions were bundled in a small pack at his feet—an extra set of robes, a wooden cup, a thin blanket, and the dried rations allocated to support staff.

The hall gradually filled with disciples of various ranks, their voices echoing off the stone walls. Most were outer disciples like Wei Liang, though their gray robes were newer, their postures more confident. They clustered in small groups, excitement and apprehension mingling in their conversations. An expedition to the Shattered Wastes carried prestige even for those in supporting roles—assuming they returned.

"...heard there's a formation array from before the divine war..."

"...Elder Shen wouldn't authorize this without good reason..."

"...chance to prove ourselves to the inner disciples..."

Wei Liang absorbed their words without changing his expression. Formation arrays from the era of the forgotten gods were dangerous beyond measure—powerful enough to reshape reality but often corrupted by the cataclysm that created the Wastes. Whatever Feng Zhao sought there, it wasn't mere spiritual resources.

The hall fell silent as the inner disciples arrived, led by Feng Zhao himself. He wore combat robes rather than the formal sect attire, with protective talismans sewn into the fabric and a wooden sword sheathed at his waist. Behind him came five other inner disciples, all at least at the late stages of Foundation Establishment, their expressions serious and focused.

Feng Zhao surveyed the assembled disciples, his gaze passing over Wei Liang without acknowledgment. "The expedition to the Shattered Wastes begins today. Our objective is to locate and retrieve a specific artifact from the eastern quadrant. You've all been selected for your particular skills."

Wei Liang kept his face carefully neutral. His "particular skill" was his expendability, nothing more.

"The journey will take three days to reach the Wastes' periphery," Feng Zhao continued. "Once there, we'll establish a base camp. Inner disciples will form the exploration team, while outer disciples will maintain the camp and secure our retreat path. This is not a training exercise. The Wastes are hostile territory where reality itself is unstable. Follow instructions precisely or risk being left behind."

The threat hung in the air, all the more effective for its matter-of-fact delivery. Wei Liang noticed several outer disciples shifting uncomfortably.

"Equipment distribution will begin immediately. We depart in one hour. Dismissed."

As the disciples moved toward the supply tables, Wei Liang remained in place, waiting until the initial rush subsided. He knew his role would be determined last, after all meaningful positions were assigned. When he finally approached the distribution area, only the heaviest packs remained—tents, cooking equipment, and other burdens deemed too menial for disciples with actual cultivation potential.

"Wei Liang." The supply master checked a list. "You're assigned to general portage and camp maintenance. Take packs seven and twelve."

Wei Liang nodded and lifted the designated packs. Their weight was substantial, designed for disciples who could reinforce their bodies with spiritual energy. For someone without cultivation, they would be punishing over long distances. He adjusted the straps across his shoulders, distributing the weight as evenly as possible.

As he turned to leave, he noticed Liu Mei at another table, carefully packing medicinal herbs into a specialized container. Their eyes met briefly. She gave him a small nod—not friendly exactly, but acknowledging his existence, which was more than most bothered with. Wei Liang returned the gesture before making his way outside.

The expedition assembled in the sect's main courtyard under a sky heavy with unshed rain. Twenty disciples in total—six inner and fourteen outer—arranged in formation with Feng Zhao at the lead. Wei Liang took his place at the rear, where the weakest and least important traditionally stood. From this position, he could observe everyone while remaining largely unnoticed.

A small crowd had gathered to see them off, mostly other disciples and a few elders. Wei Liang scanned the onlookers, surprised to find Yun Hua among them. She stood slightly apart from the others, her expression thoughtful. When her gaze met his, she made a subtle gesture with her hand—a water element sign for caution. Wei Liang blinked in acknowledgment, careful not to show any other reaction.

Feng Zhao raised his hand, and the expedition began to move. They passed through the sect gates and onto the mountain path that would take them down to the valley below. No one spoke. The only sounds were footsteps on stone and the distant rumble of thunder.

Wei Liang focused on his breathing as they descended, using techniques he had read about to manage the strain of the heavy packs. Each step sent jolts of pain through his shoulders and back, but he kept pace, knowing that falling behind would only draw unwanted attention.

The rain began as they reached the valley floor, a gentle shower that quickly intensified into a downpour. The inner disciples activated water-repelling talismans, creating invisible barriers that kept them dry. The outer disciples had simpler protective charms that merely prevented their robes from becoming sodden. Wei Liang had nothing, and within minutes he was drenched, his robes clinging to his skin, water running in rivulets down his face.

They continued through the rain for hours, following a trade road that wound through forests and fields. Occasionally they passed small villages where farmers paused in their work to watch the sect disciples march by. Wei Liang noted how the villagers bowed their heads respectfully as the inner disciples passed, then returned to their tasks without waiting for the rear of the formation. To them, he and the other support staff were invisible—an appropriate metaphor for his entire existence.

By midday, the rain had stopped, but the damage was done. Wei Liang's soaked robes chafed against his skin, and his sodden shoes had begun to blister his feet. The weight of the packs seemed to increase with each mile, the straps digging into his shoulders like dull knives. He maintained his pace through sheer determination, focusing on the rhythm of his breathing and the placement of each foot.

When Feng Zhao finally called for a rest, Wei Liang carefully lowered his packs to the ground, keeping his face impassive despite the relief that flooded his muscles. They had stopped beside a small stream, the water clear and swift after the rain. The inner disciples gathered upstream, while the outer disciples spread out along the banks.

Wei Liang found a spot downstream from everyone else and knelt by the water. He cupped his hands and drank deeply, the cold water soothing his parched throat. As he straightened, he caught sight of his reflection in the stream—a pale face with hollow cheeks, dark circles under watchful eyes, hair plastered to his skull by the earlier rain. He looked exactly what he was: a burden-bearer, a tool to be used and discarded.

"You should dry your robes while you can."

Wei Liang turned to find Liu Mei standing nearby, her expression neutral but not unkind. Unlike him, she appeared relatively unaffected by the journey, her movements easy and controlled.

"The next stretch has no shelter," she continued when he didn't respond. "Wet clothing in mountain air leads to sickness."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. "Thank you for the advice."

He had spoken to Liu Mei perhaps a dozen times in the three years since his elevation to outer disciple. She worked in the sect's medicine hall, specializing in herb cultivation rather than combat techniques. They had occasionally crossed paths when he was assigned to clean the greenhouses or deliver supplies. She had never been cruel to him, which in the context of the sect made her practically benevolent.

Liu Mei glanced at the heavy packs beside him. "Those are meant for disciples who can channel spiritual energy for reinforcement."

"I manage," Wei Liang said simply.

She studied him for a moment, her practical nature evident in her assessing gaze. "There are pressure points that can temporarily reduce pain. They're not a substitute for cultivation, but they might help."

Before Wei Liang could respond, a sharp voice cut through the air.

"Liu Mei! Are you consulting with our rootless disciple about cultivation techniques? How ambitious of him."

Feng Zhao approached from upstream, his expression one of amused disdain. Two other inner disciples flanked him, watching the exchange with interest.

Liu Mei bowed respectfully. "Senior Brother Feng, I was discussing medicinal matters only. Preventing sickness among the support staff will ensure the expedition's efficiency."

Her practical framing of the interaction was clever, Wei Liang noted. She had presented her assistance not as kindness but as expedition management—something Feng Zhao could hardly object to without seeming petty.

Feng Zhao's smile didn't reach his eyes. "How conscientious. But don't waste too much time. Some vessels are simply too flawed to hold water, no matter how carefully you tend them."

The metaphor was deliberate—a water element saying twisted into an insult. Wei Liang kept his gaze lowered, his face expressionless.

"We resume in ten minutes," Feng Zhao announced, loud enough for all to hear. "Anyone not ready will be left to catch up on their own."

He walked away, his companions following. Liu Mei waited until they were out of earshot before speaking again, her voice low.

"The pressure points are here and here." She touched her own shoulder briefly, indicating locations. "Press firmly for ten breaths when the pain becomes too much."

Wei Liang committed the positions to memory. "Thank you."

Liu Mei nodded once, then returned to her own preparations. Wei Liang quickly wrung out his robes as best he could and used the brief remaining time to massage the pressure points she had shown him. The relief was minor but noticeable—enough to make the difference between endurance and collapse in the miles ahead.

When Feng Zhao called for the expedition to continue, Wei Liang shouldered his packs with renewed determination. The path now led upward, leaving the valley and climbing into the foothills that separated the sect's territory from the wilderness beyond. The terrain grew increasingly rugged, with narrow trails winding between rocky outcroppings and sparse, wind-twisted trees.

By evening, they had reached a plateau where Feng Zhao ordered camp to be established. Wei Liang worked silently alongside the other outer disciples, erecting tents, gathering firewood, and preparing the evening meal. His body ached from the day's journey, but he moved with practiced efficiency, completing each task without complaint.

The camp formed a rough circle, with the inner disciples' tents at the center and the outer disciples arranged around the periphery. Wei Liang was assigned the furthest position from the center—the least protected spot should danger approach during the night. He set up his small tent with methodical precision, then reported for his night watch assignment.

"Third watch," the duty roster keeper told him without looking up. "Northwest perimeter."

The third watch was the most difficult—the deepest part of night when the body craved sleep most desperately. The northwest perimeter faced away from the direction they had come, toward the distant Wastes. Wei Liang accepted the assignment with a bow and returned to his tent.

He ate his portion of the evening meal alone, a simple bowl of rice and preserved vegetables. Around him, the other disciples gathered in small groups, sharing food and conversation. The inner disciples sat apart, their voices carrying as they discussed the days ahead.

"The target location is approximately two days into the eastern quadrant," Feng Zhao was saying. "According to Elder Shen's information, the formation array remains partially intact despite the reality distortions."

"What exactly are we retrieving?" asked one of the other inner disciples.

"A control node from the array. Elder Shen believes it contains cultivation insights from before the divine war."

Wei Liang kept his head down, but his ears caught every word. A control node from an ancient formation array would be incredibly valuable—and incredibly dangerous. Such artifacts were often corrupted by the cataclysm that created the Wastes, their functions twisted in unpredictable ways.

As darkness fell, the camp grew quiet. Wei Liang retreated to his tent but did not sleep. Instead, he sat cross-legged on his thin bedroll and began the breathing exercises that had become his nightly ritual. Though he could not cultivate in the traditional sense, the techniques still helped prepare his body for the challenges ahead.

He focused on each breath, imagining spiritual energy flowing through the meridians he had memorized from forbidden texts. In his mind, he traced the paths that spiritual energy should follow, envisioning the circulation that would strengthen his body and refine his spirit—if only he had a spirit root to gather that energy.

Time passed in measured breaths until it was his turn for watch duty. Wei Liang emerged from his tent into the cold night air. The sky had cleared after the day's rain, revealing a vast expanse of stars overhead. He made his way to the northwest perimeter and took up his position, scanning the darkness beyond the camp's boundary.

The night was alive with small sounds—the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze, the distant call of night birds, the soft breathing of sleeping disciples. Wei Liang stood motionless, his senses alert for anything unusual. This far from the sect, wild beasts were a concern, though the greater dangers would come when they reached the Wastes themselves.

As the hours of his watch passed, Wei Liang's thoughts turned to what lay ahead. The Shattered Wastes were not merely dangerous territory—they were a wound in reality itself, a place where the laws of nature had been broken during the war of the forgotten gods. Few ventured there willingly, and those who did often returned changed, if they returned at all.

He had read every account of the Wastes available in the sect library, committing the descriptions to memory. Reality fissures that could transport a person miles in an instant. Zones where time flowed differently, where minutes might pass as hours or years as moments. Corrupted spiritual energy that could twist cultivation techniques back upon their users. Strange entities that defied classification, neither beast nor spirit but something in between.

And yet, for all its dangers, the Wastes held a strange allure for Wei Liang. In a place where reality itself was broken, perhaps the rules that defined his existence—that deemed him worthless for lack of a spirit root—might also break. It was a foolish thought, born of desperation rather than reason, but it lingered nonetheless.

Movement at the edge of his vision snapped Wei Liang back to alertness. He turned slowly, careful not to make any sudden motions that might provoke a response. At first, he saw nothing but shadows among the rocks that dotted the plateau's edge. Then a deeper darkness moved—something large and silent, watching the camp from just beyond the perimeter.

Wei Liang remained still, weighing his options. Protocol required alerting the camp to potential threats, but doing so without confirmation would earn him mockery at best, punishment at worst. He needed to identify the intruder first.

Slowly, he reached for a small stone at his feet. With a precise flick of his wrist, he sent it arcing toward the darkness where he had seen movement. The stone clattered against rock, and the shadow moved—not away, as a startled animal might, but toward the sound, with deliberate purpose.

In the faint starlight, Wei Liang caught a glimpse of the intruder—a creature like a mountain cat but larger, with too many limbs arranged in unsettling asymmetry. Its eyes reflected the distant campfire with an unnatural purple glow. A Waste-touched beast, corrupted by proximity to the shattered reality beyond the mountains.

Wei Liang backed toward the camp, keeping his movements slow and his eyes on the creature. When he judged himself close enough to be heard without shouting, he spoke in a clear, controlled voice.

"Waste-touched beast at the northwest perimeter. Approximately thirty paces out."

The camp erupted into activity. Inner disciples emerged from their tents, spiritual energy already gathering around their hands. Outer disciples scrambled for weapons or defensive positions according to their assigned roles. Wei Liang held his ground, continuing to watch the creature as it assessed the suddenly alert camp.

Feng Zhao strode forward, his wooden sword now unsheathed and glowing with green spiritual energy. "Where?"

Wei Liang pointed. "Among the rocks. Felid form, multiple limbs, purple eye-shine."

Feng Zhao narrowed his eyes, scanning the darkness. The creature chose that moment to move, slinking between two boulders with unnatural fluidity. Feng Zhao raised his sword, wood element energy coalescing around the blade.

"Verdant Binding," he intoned, slashing the sword in a precise pattern.

Tendrils of green energy shot from the blade, crossing the distance to the creature in an instant. They wrapped around the beast, immobilizing it mid-stride. It thrashed against the bindings, a sound like grinding stone emerging from its throat.

Two other inner disciples moved to flank Feng Zhao, their own techniques ready. One wielded fire element energy that formed a blazing spear in his hand, while the other manipulated metal element energy into floating needles that orbited his body.

"Waste-touched beasts often travel in groups," Feng Zhao said, his eyes never leaving the captured creature. "Secure the perimeter. Search in pairs."

The disciples spread out, checking the camp's boundaries for additional threats. Wei Liang remained at his post, watching the captured beast as it struggled against Feng Zhao's technique. Its movements were becoming more erratic, its form seeming to shift and blur at the edges.

"Senior Brother Feng," Wei Liang said quietly, "the creature's form is destabilizing."

Feng Zhao glanced at him with irritation, then back at the beast. His eyes widened slightly as he observed the same phenomenon—the creature's outline wavering like heat distortion, its limbs occasionally seeming to pass through the energy bindings rather than being constrained by them.

"Reality fluctuation," Feng Zhao muttered. "We're closer to the Wastes' influence than I thought."

He made a sharp gesture with his sword, and the green energy bindings constricted violently. The creature emitted a sound like shattering glass, then collapsed into itself, its form dissolving into motes of purple light that scattered on the night breeze.

Wei Liang watched the dissolution with a mixture of fascination and dread. The beast hadn't died in any conventional sense—it had unraveled, its corrupted existence unable to maintain coherence once its connection to the Wastes was severed.

"No other threats detected," reported one of the returning inner disciples.

Feng Zhao nodded, sheathing his sword. "Double the watch for the remainder of the night. We'll reach the Wastes' periphery by tomorrow evening—earlier than expected if their influence has already spread this far."

His gaze fell on Wei Liang. "You spotted it first."

It wasn't a question or a compliment, merely an observation. Wei Liang inclined his head slightly, acknowledging without speaking.

"Return to your post," Feng Zhao said after a moment. "Report any further anomalies immediately."

Wei Liang bowed and returned to the northwest perimeter. The encounter had changed something subtle in the expedition's dynamics. He had performed his duty effectively, demonstrating value beyond mere burden-bearing. It wouldn't last—such moments never did—but for now, he existed in the rare space between invisibility and targeting.

The remainder of his watch passed without incident, and when his replacement arrived, Wei Liang returned to his tent. Sleep came in fitful bursts, his dreams filled with creatures that unraveled at the edges and purple light that whispered in voices just beyond comprehension.

Morning arrived with a blood-red sunrise that painted the mountains in ominous hues. The camp stirred to life, disciples preparing for the day's journey with greater urgency after the night's encounter. Wei Liang packed his few possessions and dismantled his tent with practiced efficiency, then reported for assignment.

"You'll take point today," the expedition coordinator told him, to Wei Liang's carefully concealed surprise. "Thirty paces ahead of the main group. Watch for signs of Waste-touched corruption and report back immediately if you spot anything unusual."

Point position was dangerous—the first to encounter threats, with the least support. It was also, Wei Liang recognized, a test. His performance during the night watch had earned him this opportunity to prove his worth—or to serve as the first casualty if they encountered more serious dangers.

He accepted the assignment with a bow and moved to the front of the forming expedition. As he waited for the signal to begin, Liu Mei approached, carrying a small cloth packet.

"Medicinal paste," she said, handing it to him. "For your shoulders and feet. Apply it during rest periods."

Wei Liang accepted the packet with genuine gratitude. "Thank you."

Liu Mei glanced toward the inner disciples, then back to Wei Liang. "Point position after spotting the Waste-touched beast. Interesting."

"A test," Wei Liang replied quietly.

She nodded. "Or expendability dressed as opportunity."

Before he could respond, Feng Zhao gave the signal to move out. Wei Liang secured the medicinal packet in his robes and started forward, maintaining the prescribed thirty-pace distance ahead of the main group.

The day's path led them higher into the mountains, following ancient trails that wound between towering peaks. The air grew thinner, each breath providing less satisfaction than the last. For the cultivators behind him, this posed little challenge—they could supplement their breathing with spiritual energy. For Wei Liang, it meant carefully managing his exertion, finding the balance between maintaining pace and conserving strength.

As they climbed, the landscape began to change in subtle ways. The vegetation grew sparser but stranger—plants with leaves that turned to follow sounds rather than sunlight, flowers that closed when approached, trees whose bark spiraled in mathematically impossible patterns. The wildlife, too, became increasingly unusual. Birds with too many wings circled overhead, while insects with geometrically perfect patterns crawled across stones that occasionally shifted position when no one was looking directly at them.

Wei Liang cataloged each anomaly, reporting back at regular intervals. The boundary between normal reality and the Wastes' influence was not a clear line but a gradual transition, with corruption becoming more pronounced the further they traveled. By midday, there was no doubt they had entered the periphery of the Shattered Wastes.

They stopped to rest beside a stream that flowed uphill in defiance of gravity. The water itself seemed normal when collected in cups or waterskins, but returned to its impossible course when poured back. The inner disciples examined the phenomenon with academic interest, while most of the outer disciples kept their distance, discomforted by the blatant violation of natural law.

Wei Liang used the break to apply Liu Mei's medicinal paste to his shoulders and feet. The effect was immediate—a cooling sensation that penetrated deep into his abused muscles, numbing pain and reducing inflammation. He recognized the scent of several rare herbs, combined in proportions that suggested significant skill. Such medicine would normally never be wasted on someone like him.

As he finished, he noticed Feng Zhao watching him from across the stream. The inner disciple's expression was unreadable, but his attention was deliberate, assessing. Wei Liang met his gaze for a brief moment before lowering his eyes, the proper response for an outer disciple. When he looked up again, Feng Zhao had turned away, deep in conversation with the other inner disciples.

The expedition resumed with Wei Liang again taking point. The trail now led through a narrow pass between two peaks that didn't quite match—one composed of dark granite, the other of pale limestone, their geological impossibility another sign of the Wastes' influence. As he entered the pass, Wei Liang felt a subtle pressure against his skin, as if the air itself had thickened.

He paused, raising his hand in the signal for caution. The expedition halted behind him as Feng Zhao moved forward to investigate.

"What is it?" he asked, his hand resting on his sword hilt.

"The air density changed," Wei Liang replied. "And there's a sound at the edge of hearing. Like whispers."

Feng Zhao frowned, extending his spiritual sense forward. After a moment, his expression sharpened with interest. "A reality fissure. Minor, but active."

He turned and gestured to the other inner disciples. "Formation positions. We'll pass through in controlled sequence."

The inner disciples arranged themselves in a hexagonal pattern, with outer disciples grouped in the center. Wei Liang found himself positioned near Feng Zhao, who began tracing complex patterns in the air with spiritual energy. The other inner disciples followed suit, creating a protective formation that surrounded the entire expedition.

"The fissure extends through the entire pass," Feng Zhao explained as he worked. "We'll move through together. Stay within the formation boundaries. Any separation could result in displacement to unknown locations within the Wastes."

When the formation was complete, they began moving forward as a single unit. As they entered the pass proper, the whispers Wei Liang had detected grew louder, resolving into overlapping voices speaking words that almost made sense. The air shimmered like heat distortion, occasionally revealing glimpses of other places—a vast plain of shattered glass, a forest of trees with mirrored leaves, a city whose architecture defied perspective.

Wei Liang kept his focus on the path ahead, ignoring the voices that seemed to call his name with increasing urgency. The pressure against his skin intensified, as if reality itself resisted their passage. Around him, the other disciples showed signs of strain—beads of sweat on their foreheads, tightened grips on weapons or talismans, quickened breathing.

Halfway through the pass, the fissure's effects intensified dramatically. The glimpses of other places became more frequent and substantial, sometimes overlapping with their current reality. Wei Liang's vision blurred as his mind struggled to reconcile the contradictory input. He stumbled, momentarily disoriented.

A hand gripped his arm, steadying him. To his surprise, it was Feng Zhao, his expression tense with concentration as he maintained the formation while keeping Wei Liang from straying beyond its boundaries.

"Focus on my voice," Feng Zhao commanded. "Count your steps. One through ten, then repeat."

Wei Liang obeyed, using the simple mental exercise to anchor himself against the fissure's disorienting effects. "One, two, three..."

They continued through the pass, each step requiring deliberate effort. The whispers grew to a cacophony, then abruptly ceased as they reached the far side. The pressure vanished, and reality snapped back into focus—still corrupted by the Wastes' influence, but stable in its corruption.

Feng Zhao released Wei Liang's arm and dissolved the formation with a gesture. "Everyone present?"

A quick count confirmed that the entire expedition had made it through intact. Several disciples looked shaken, and one outer disciple was vomiting at the side of the path, his body rejecting the experience of passing through the fissure.

"That was a minor fissure," Feng Zhao said, his voice carrying to all. "The deeper we go, the more severe they become. Remember your training. Focus on concrete details—counting, physical sensations, memorized texts. These can anchor you when reality becomes fluid."

Wei Liang noted the advice, adding it to his mental catalog of survival techniques. He had no formal training to fall back on, but he had his own methods—the breathing exercises, the memorized meridian paths, the cultivation theories he had studied in secret. Perhaps these would serve a similar purpose.

They continued onward, the landscape growing increasingly alien with each mile. Trees twisted into impossible knots, their branches occasionally reaching out to grasp at passing disciples. Rocks floated at eye level, rotating slowly around invisible axes. In one clearing, they found a perfect circle of flowers that aged from bud to bloom to decay and back again in endless cycles that took mere minutes to complete.

By late afternoon, they reached their destination for the day—a relatively stable plateau overlooking a valley that shimmered with distortion. Feng Zhao ordered camp established, with additional protective formations around the perimeter.

"We've reached the true boundary of the Shattered Wastes," he announced as the camp took shape. "Beyond that valley lies the eastern quadrant and our objective. We'll rest here tonight and enter at first light."

Wei Liang helped establish the camp, erecting tents and gathering what passed for firewood in this corrupted landscape—branches that remained warm to the touch long after being cut and occasionally hummed with discordant notes when stacked together. As he worked, he observed the valley below, noting how the distortions formed patterns that shifted and flowed like currents in water.

The Shattered Wastes proper. Tomorrow they would enter one of the most dangerous places in the world, seeking an artifact of immense power and unknown corruption. Wei Liang had no illusions about his role in what was to come. When danger threatened, the expendable would be expended. His only advantage was that everyone, including Feng Zhao, underestimated him—a lifetime of being overlooked had taught him to move unnoticed, to observe without being observed, to survive in the margins.

As night fell, the Wastes revealed new wonders and horrors. The sky above the valley rippled with auroras in colors that had no names, while the darkness between stars seemed to deepen until it formed shapes that moved with purpose. Strange calls echoed from the valley, some beautiful enough to draw tears, others so discordant they set teeth on edge.

Wei Liang took his assigned watch at the eastern perimeter, facing the valley that awaited them. As he stood his vigil, he felt something he had rarely experienced before—anticipation. Beyond that shimmering barrier of broken reality lay the unknown, yes, but also possibility. In a place where the laws of nature had shattered, perhaps the laws that had defined his life might also break.

The thought was dangerous, a seed of hope in soil that had long been salted with disappointment. Yet as he watched the impossible auroras paint the night with their nameless colors, Wei Liang allowed the seed to take root.

Tomorrow, they would enter the Shattered Wastes. Tomorrow, everything might change.



# Chapter 3: The Betrayal

Morning in the Shattered Wastes arrived with unsettling beauty. The sun rose not from the horizon but from the center of the sky, its light fragmenting through reality distortions into prismatic beams that painted the landscape in impossible colors. Wei Liang watched the phenomenon from the edge of camp, having finished his pre-dawn duties while most of the expedition still slept.

The valley below was now clearly visible in the strange morning light. What had appeared as shimmering distortion the previous evening revealed itself as a fractured landscape—islands of earth floating at various heights, rivers that flowed in loops and spirals defying gravity, forests where each tree existed in a different season. And cutting through it all, reality fissures that appeared as jagged tears in the air itself, edges glowing with energies that hurt the eyes if observed too directly.

"Magnificent, isn't it?" 

Wei Liang turned to find one of the inner disciples standing nearby—Disciple Chen, the youngest of the inner circle and the only one who had occasionally acknowledged Wei Liang's existence without contempt. His expression now was one of scholarly fascination as he surveyed the valley.

"And terrible," Wei Liang replied quietly.

Chen glanced at him with mild surprise, perhaps not expecting a philosophical observation from a rootless disciple. "Yes. Beauty and horror intertwined. The texts say the Wastes reflect the conflict that created them—divine powers both creative and destructive unleashed without restraint."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. He had read the same texts, though he wasn't supposed to have access to them. The divine war had been a cataclysm beyond mortal comprehension, fought with weapons that targeted reality itself. The forgotten gods had fallen or transcended, but their battlefield remained—a wound in the world that refused to heal.

"We enter within the hour," Chen said after a moment. "Senior Brother Feng has identified a path to the target location that should minimize exposure to major fissures."

"Should," Wei Liang repeated, the word carrying the weight of its uncertainty.

Chen's mouth quirked in what might have been the ghost of a smile. "Indeed. The Wastes are nothing if not unpredictable." He turned to leave, then paused. "Stay alert today, Wei Liang. The deeper we go, the more dangerous the journey becomes—for all of us."

The warning—or was it advice?—was unexpected. Wei Liang inclined his head in acknowledgment, and Chen returned to the center of camp where the inner disciples were gathering.

The expedition prepared with methodical efficiency, breaking down the camp and organizing equipment for the descent into the valley. Wei Liang was assigned to carry additional protective talismans and emergency supplies—items that would be needed if things went wrong, making him simultaneously burden-bearer and safeguard.

Feng Zhao addressed the group before they departed, his expression severe. "We enter the true Wastes now. Reality here is unstable and hostile. Maintain formation at all times. Outer disciples will establish a base camp at the first stable location we find. Inner disciples will continue to the target site. Expected return is before nightfall."

His gaze swept over the assembled disciples, lingering briefly on Wei Liang. "Any sign of corruption or instability in any expedition member is to be reported immediately. The Wastes affect minds as well as bodies. Confusion, memory lapses, or unusual behavior could indicate corruption."

The implication was clear—they would leave behind anyone who became a liability. Wei Liang absorbed this information without changing his expression. It was nothing more than he had expected.

They descended into the valley along a narrow path that wound between reality distortions. Feng Zhao led, using a specialized compass that detected stability rather than direction. Wei Liang was positioned in the middle of the formation this time, surrounded by other outer disciples—not out of concern for his safety, he knew, but to ensure the emergency supplies he carried remained accessible.

The air changed as they entered the valley proper, becoming thicker and somehow textured, as if each breath had to be pulled through layers of invisible resistance. Sounds behaved strangely, sometimes reaching the ear long after their source had moved on, other times arriving before the event that caused them. Wei Liang found himself hearing footsteps before they fell, voices before lips moved.

He focused on his breathing, using the techniques he had practiced for years to center himself. The Wastes might distort external reality, but his internal discipline remained a constant he could rely on.

The path led them through a forest of crystalline trees that chimed softly when the wind blew, each note sustaining longer than natural acoustics should allow. The ground beneath their feet occasionally rippled like water, though it remained solid enough to walk on. Overhead, birds with geometrically perfect plumage flew in formations that seemed to leave afterimages in the air.

They encountered their first major obstacle at a river that flowed in a vertical loop, water rushing upward against gravity before curving and falling back to the ground in a perpetual cycle. The only crossing point was a bridge of stone that phased in and out of existence at irregular intervals.

Feng Zhao studied the pattern for several minutes before turning to the expedition. "We'll cross in pairs, timing the bridge's manifestation. Inner disciples first to secure the far side, then outer disciples with essential supplies."

The crossing proceeded as ordered, disciples waiting for Feng Zhao's signal before sprinting across the temporarily solid bridge. Wei Liang watched carefully, noting how the bridge's manifestation cycle was gradually shortening—a detail he suspected Feng Zhao had also observed, explaining the increasing urgency of his commands.

When Wei Liang's turn came, the bridge was visible for barely five seconds at a time. He waited for Feng Zhao's signal, then ran, his feet pounding against stone that felt increasingly insubstantial with each step. The bridge began to fade as he reached the halfway point, edges dissolving into mist.

Wei Liang pushed himself harder, lungs burning as he sprinted the final distance. The stone beneath his final step had already half-vanished, providing minimal purchase. He leapt the last few feet, landing heavily on the far bank as the bridge disappeared completely behind him.

"Cutting it close, rootless," Feng Zhao remarked, his tone suggesting he wouldn't have been particularly troubled if Wei Liang had fallen.

Wei Liang straightened, adjusting the packs he carried. "This disciple apologizes for the delay."

Feng Zhao's eyes narrowed slightly at the formal response, perhaps searching for hidden insolence. Finding none in Wei Liang's carefully neutral expression, he turned away to oversee the remaining crossings.

They continued deeper into the Wastes, the corruption of reality growing more pronounced with each mile. Gravity became inconsistent—stronger in some places, weaker in others. Light bent around objects in impossible ways, creating shadows that moved independently of their sources. The very ground seemed uncertain of its nature, sometimes hard as stone, other times yielding like moss regardless of its appearance.

By midday, they reached a relatively stable area where Feng Zhao ordered the base camp established. It was a circular clearing surrounded by twisted trees whose branches grew inward rather than outward, creating a natural barrier. The ground here maintained consistent properties, and the air was clearer than in the surrounding areas.

"Outer disciples will remain here and establish defensive formations," Feng Zhao announced. "Inner disciples will continue to the target location, approximately two hours from this position."

He designated one of the senior outer disciples as camp leader, then selected three others to accompany the inner disciples as porters. To Wei Liang's carefully concealed surprise, he was among those chosen.

"You'll carry the containment vessel," Feng Zhao told him, indicating an ornate box crafted from multiple materials—wood, metal, water crystal, and stone segments fitted together in complex patterns. "It's designed to safely transport the artifact. Do not open it under any circumstances."

Wei Liang accepted the vessel with a bow, securing it in a specialized harness that distributed its considerable weight across his shoulders and back. The construction was fascinating—each material segment positioned to balance and contain different energy types, with formation arrays carved into the surfaces in script so ancient he could only recognize fragments.

As the inner disciples prepared to depart, Liu Mei approached Wei Liang, ostensibly checking the supplies he carried. Under the pretense of adjusting a strap, she spoke quietly.

"The vessel you're carrying—it's designed for corrupted artifacts. Be careful. If the artifact is activated, the vessel will seal automatically, trapping anything in contact with it."

Wei Liang gave a nearly imperceptible nod to indicate he understood. "Thank you."

Liu Mei stepped back, her expression professionally neutral once more. "The medicinal paste should last through today. Apply again if you feel strain returning."

She returned to her assigned duties, leaving Wei Liang to contemplate her warning. The containment vessel was both protection and potential trap—useful information that Feng Zhao had not bothered to share with the expendable porter assigned to carry it.

The reduced expedition departed the base camp, following a path that grew increasingly difficult to discern. The inner disciples used spiritual energy to maintain their footing on terrain that shifted between solid, liquid, and gaseous states without warning. The three outer disciples, including Wei Liang, struggled to keep pace, occasionally slipping or sinking before being impatiently assisted by their superiors.

They passed through areas where time itself seemed damaged. In one clearing, they observed a fallen tree simultaneously rotting into soil and growing from a sapling, its entire lifecycle visible at once. In another, they walked through a zone where their movements left persistent afterimages that faded only gradually, creating a forest of ghost-selves that mimicked their actions with decreasing fidelity.

Throughout the journey, Wei Liang maintained his focus on the immediate task, carefully managing his energy and attention. The Wastes presented constant distractions—whispers that seemed to come from nowhere, visions at the corner of the eye, sensations that couldn't possibly be real. He recognized these as the mental effects Feng Zhao had warned about, the Wastes attempting to corrupt not just body but mind.

After nearly two hours of increasingly difficult travel, they reached their destination—a crater-like depression in the landscape, at the center of which stood the remains of a massive formation array. Stone pillars arranged in concentric circles surrounded a central platform, each carved with symbols that glowed with faint, pulsing light. The entire structure was partially translucent, as if existing simultaneously in multiple reality layers.

Feng Zhao raised his hand, signaling a halt at the crater's edge. "We've arrived. The control node should be at the array's center. Inner disciples will approach in formation. Porters remain here until called."

The inner disciples arranged themselves in a hexagonal pattern and began their careful descent into the crater, spiritual energy visibly circulating between them to maintain a protective barrier. Wei Liang and the other two porters watched from above, the containment vessel a heavy presence on Wei Liang's back.

As the inner disciples reached the first ring of pillars, the array responded. The glowing symbols brightened, and a low hum filled the air, more felt than heard. The ground within the crater began to shimmer, reality becoming even less stable than in the surrounding Wastes.

Wei Liang observed with careful attention, noting how the inner disciples adjusted their formation to counter the array's effects. Feng Zhao led them in a specific pattern, moving from pillar to pillar in what appeared to be a predetermined sequence. Each correct step caused certain symbols to dim while others brightened, gradually opening a path to the center.

It was, Wei Liang realized, a lock—an ancient security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to whatever lay at the array's heart. Feng Zhao must have obtained the correct sequence from Elder Shen or sect records, knowledge that would be incredibly valuable and carefully guarded.

After nearly thirty minutes of methodical progress, the inner disciples reached the central platform. From his position at the crater's edge, Wei Liang could see a pedestal at the center, upon which rested a crystalline object approximately the size of a human heart. Even at this distance, he could sense its wrongness—the way it seemed to bend light and attention around itself, the eye sliding away unless forced to focus.

Feng Zhao gestured, and one of the inner disciples produced a set of specialized tools. Working with extreme caution, they began to disconnect the object from the pedestal, using spiritual energy to counter the occasional flares of power that erupted from the connection points.

"What exactly is that thing?" whispered one of the other porters, his voice tight with apprehension.

"A control node," replied the third porter, an older disciple with more experience. "Part of the array's core. The texts say these ancient arrays could manipulate reality itself—create pocket dimensions, alter fundamental laws within their influence radius."

"And we're taking it back to the sect?" The first porter sounded incredulous. "It's clearly corrupted."

"Elder Shen believes it can be purified and studied," the older disciple said, though his tone suggested personal doubts. "The cultivation insights from before the divine war are worth the risk."

Wei Liang kept his thoughts to himself, but inwardly he agreed with the first porter's concern. The object radiated wrongness in a way that transcended mere corruption. It felt... hungry, somehow. Aware. The containment vessel on his back seemed to grow heavier, as if responding to the proximity of what it was designed to hold.

Below, the inner disciples completed their work. The crystalline node detached from the pedestal with a sound like shattering glass that somehow reversed itself, fragments flying together rather than apart. Feng Zhao quickly encased it in a temporary spiritual barrier, his expression tense with concentration.

The moment the node separated from the pedestal, the entire array began to change. The glowing symbols flared brightly, then started to shift and rearrange themselves. The hum intensified, becoming a discordant vibration that set teeth on edge and made vision blur.

"The array is destabilizing," Feng Zhao called out, his voice carrying to the crater's edge. "We need to leave immediately. Wei Liang, bring the containment vessel down. The rest of you prepare for immediate departure."

Wei Liang didn't hesitate. He made his way down the crater's slope, careful to follow the exact path the inner disciples had taken. The ground beneath his feet felt increasingly insubstantial, as if reality itself was thinning in response to the array's destabilization.

When he reached the inner disciples, Feng Zhao was maintaining the temporary barrier around the node with visible effort. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his hands trembled slightly from the strain.

"Open the vessel," he commanded.

Wei Liang removed the containment vessel from his back and placed it on the ground, releasing the complex series of locks that held it closed. The lid rose with a hiss of escaping pressure, revealing an interior lined with the same materials as the exterior, formation arrays continuing seamlessly inside.

Feng Zhao carefully maneuvered the node toward the open vessel, his spiritual barrier contracting gradually to guide the object into its new container. As the node descended into the vessel, Wei Liang felt a sudden spike of wrongness—the hunger he had sensed earlier intensifying dramatically.

The node touched the bottom of the vessel, and several things happened simultaneously. The array's destabilization accelerated, pillars beginning to phase in and out of reality. A shock wave of corrupted energy burst from the node, disrupting Feng Zhao's spiritual barrier. And most alarmingly, tendrils of crystalline material shot from the node toward the vessel's opening, as if the object was attempting to prevent its containment.

Wei Liang reacted instinctively, slamming the vessel's lid closed before the tendrils could escape. The locks engaged automatically with a series of metallic clicks, and the vessel's formation arrays activated, glowing with power as they contained the node's influence.

"We need to move," Feng Zhao shouted, already backing toward the array's edge. "The entire structure is collapsing!"

The inner disciples retreated in formation, maintaining their protective barrier as reality around them began to fracture more severely. Wei Liang secured the containment vessel to his back once more and followed, the weight now seeming to pulse against his spine like a second heartbeat.

They had nearly reached the first ring of pillars when the array's destabilization reached critical point. A pillar directly in their path phased out of existence, then reappeared in a different position, blocking their carefully plotted exit route.

"Alternative path," Feng Zhao ordered, redirecting the formation toward a different gap between pillars.

They adjusted course, but the array's deterioration was accelerating. Pillars blinked in and out of reality randomly, while the ground beneath them rippled like the surface of a pond. The protective formation around the inner disciples flickered as they struggled to maintain it against the chaotic energies now filling the crater.

Wei Liang focused entirely on keeping his footing and staying within the protective formation's boundary. The vessel on his back grew increasingly active, vibrating against his spine and occasionally emitting high-pitched tones that seemed to interact with the array's destabilization in unpredictable ways.

They were halfway to the crater's edge when disaster struck. A reality fissure opened directly in their path, a vertical tear in the air that revealed glimpses of somewhere else—a void filled with crystalline structures similar to the node they had retrieved. The formation faltered as the inner disciples attempted to adjust their course again.

In that moment of vulnerability, the array released a pulse of energy that swept across the crater like a physical wave. The inner disciples' formation shattered, spiritual connections between them severing as they were thrown in different directions.

Wei Liang was knocked off his feet, the containment vessel's weight driving him hard into the ground. He felt something crack in his chest, pain flaring with each breath. Around him, the other disciples were similarly affected, struggling to regain their footing on ground that now undulated like a living thing.

"Regroup!" Feng Zhao shouted, already pulling himself upright. "Reform the protective barrier!"

The inner disciples staggered toward each other, attempting to reestablish their formation. Wei Liang pushed himself to his knees, then to his feet, ignoring the stabbing pain in his chest. The containment vessel felt heavier than ever, the node inside seeming to pull at him from multiple directions simultaneously.

Another reality fissure opened, then another. The crater was becoming a maze of tears in reality, each offering glimpses of impossible elsewhere. The ground continued to shift, sections rising while others fell, creating a chaotic landscape that changed by the second.

Wei Liang saw Feng Zhao looking back at him, calculating. In that moment, he knew with absolute certainty what was about to happen. He had seen that expression before—the cold assessment of value versus cost, of necessary sacrifice.

"The vessel is destabilizing the array further," Feng Zhao called to the other inner disciples. "We need to move now, before we're trapped."

One of the other inner disciples glanced at Wei Liang, then back to Feng Zhao. "What about the porters?"

"They'll follow as they can," Feng Zhao replied, his tone making it clear that their fate was secondary. "The artifact must be protected."

Wei Liang watched as the inner disciples reformed their protective barrier, now positioned between themselves and the increasingly chaotic center of the array rather than surrounding their entire group. The meaning was clear—they would protect themselves and their retreat path, leaving the porters to fend for themselves.

The other two porters realized their situation at the same moment, their expressions shifting from confusion to fear to desperate determination. They began moving toward the inner disciples, hoping to stay close enough to benefit from the partial protection of their barrier.

Wei Liang made the same calculation but reached a different conclusion. The inner disciples were moving too quickly, prioritizing their own escape. The barrier would not extend to protect the porters, regardless of how closely they followed. And with the containment vessel on his back, he was the slowest of the three.

Instead, he changed direction, moving laterally across the crater toward a section where the reality fissures were less concentrated. If he couldn't follow the inner disciples' path, he would find his own way out.

Behind him, he heard a cry. Glancing back, he saw one of the other porters caught in a reality distortion, his body stretching and compressing in ways that human flesh was never meant to endure. The second porter had nearly reached the inner disciples when a fissure opened directly in his path. He vanished mid-step, not falling into the fissure but simply ceasing to exist in this reality, perhaps shifted to whatever lay on the other side.

Wei Liang turned away, focusing entirely on his own survival. The pain in his chest made each breath a struggle, and the containment vessel's weight threatened to unbalance him with every step. But he had spent his life being overlooked and underestimated, learning to survive in the margins. If anyone could find a path through this chaos, it was him.

He skirted the edge of a reality distortion, feeling the pull of it against his skin like a strong current. The ground beneath his feet solidified briefly, giving him a moment to assess his surroundings. The crater's edge was still distant, but he could see a potential path—a ridge of relatively stable ground that wound between the worst of the fissures.

Wei Liang began to follow this path, moving as quickly as his injured body and heavy burden allowed. Behind him, he could hear the sounds of the array's continued collapse—stone grinding against stone, the crystalline tone of reality fracturing, the distant shouts of the inner disciples as they fought their way toward the crater's edge.

He had nearly reached a promising section of the ridge when he heard footsteps approaching rapidly from behind. Turning, he saw Feng Zhao running toward him, face contorted with anger and fear. The other inner disciples were nowhere to be seen.

"Give me the vessel," Feng Zhao demanded as he reached Wei Liang, his hand already extended. "The others have cleared a path to the edge. This is our only chance."

Wei Liang began to unsling the containment vessel, his movements slowed by pain and caution. As he lifted it from his shoulders, a massive tremor shook the crater. A fissure opened nearby, larger than any before, reality peeling back to reveal a void filled with shifting colors and half-formed shapes.

The ground beneath them tilted suddenly, sending both disciples sliding toward the fissure. Wei Liang managed to catch himself on an outcropping of stone, the containment vessel clutched against his chest. Feng Zhao was less fortunate, sliding several feet before catching himself, now precariously positioned between Wei Liang and the expanding fissure.

For a moment, they stared at each other across the intervening space—the rootless disciple and the cultivation prodigy, their positions suddenly, temporarily equalized by circumstance.

"Throw me the vessel," Feng Zhao called, his voice tight with urgency. "I can get it out safely."

Wei Liang hesitated, assessing the situation with the clarity of someone who had spent his life watching for threats. Feng Zhao's position was unstable, the ground beneath him continuing to shift toward the fissure. The distance between them was significant, making any throw risky. And most tellingly, Feng Zhao's eyes held not just urgency but calculation—the same look Wei Liang had seen when he was selected for this expedition.

"I can make it to the edge with the vessel," Wei Liang replied, already beginning to move along his identified path. "Follow if you can."

Feng Zhao's expression transformed, shock giving way to fury. "You dare? You rootless nothing! That vessel belongs to the sect!"

"And I will return it to the sect," Wei Liang said, continuing his careful movement along the ridge. "If you wish to ensure that happens, help me reach the edge."

For a moment, it seemed Feng Zhao might actually consider cooperation. Then his expression hardened, and he reached for his wooden sword. "You leave me no choice."

Wei Liang had anticipated this response. In Feng Zhao's mind, a rootless disciple refusing an order was unforgivable, regardless of circumstance. He would rather risk the vessel than allow such defiance to stand.

Before Feng Zhao could fully draw his sword, another tremor shook the crater. The ground beneath him gave way completely, and he began to slide directly toward the fissure. His face transformed from anger to terror as he scrabbled for purchase on the disintegrating ground.

Wei Liang had a split-second decision to make. He could attempt to help Feng Zhao, likely resulting in both of them falling into the fissure. Or he could continue along his path, using this moment to escape while Feng Zhao was occupied with his own survival.

The choice was made for him when Feng Zhao, in his desperation, directed a spiritual attack toward Wei Liang—a last attempt to stop him from escaping with the vessel. The green energy of his wood element technique lashed out like a whip, aiming not for Wei Liang directly but for the stone outcropping that provided his stability.

The attack struck true, shattering the outcropping and sending Wei Liang tumbling down the slope. The containment vessel slipped from his grasp, sliding several feet away before coming to rest against a section of broken pillar.

Wei Liang and Feng Zhao locked eyes across the chaotic landscape, both now in equally precarious positions. In that moment of shared peril, Wei Liang saw something unexpected in Feng Zhao's expression—not just fear or anger, but a flicker of recognition. For perhaps the first time, the inner disciple was seeing him not as a rootless nothing but as another person fighting for survival.

The moment passed as quickly as it had come. Feng Zhao turned his attention to saving himself, using his spiritual energy to stabilize the ground beneath him and begin pulling himself away from the fissure's edge.

Wei Liang did the same in his own way, without spiritual energy to aid him. He dug his fingers into the unstable ground, ignoring the pain as stones cut into his flesh. With agonizing slowness, he pulled himself toward the containment vessel, every movement a battle against gravity and the crater's continuing collapse.

He had nearly reached the vessel when he heard a shout of triumph. Feng Zhao had managed to reach a more stable section and was now making his way toward the vessel as well, his movements enhanced by spiritual energy.

It would be a race, and one Wei Liang could not win. Without cultivation, he could not match Feng Zhao's speed or strength. The inner disciple would reach the vessel first, claim it, and leave Wei Liang behind to die in the collapsing array.

Unless...

Wei Liang changed direction, no longer moving toward the vessel but toward a nearby reality fissure—smaller than the one that had nearly claimed Feng Zhao, but still a tear in the fabric of existence. He positioned himself between this fissure and the vessel, then called out.

"Feng Zhao! The vessel is yours if you can claim it!"

The inner disciple's head snapped up, eyes narrowing at Wei Liang's apparent surrender. He altered his course slightly, moving more directly toward the containment vessel, his focus entirely on his prize.

Wei Liang waited until Feng Zhao was fully committed to his approach, then acted. With all his remaining strength, he slammed his fist into the ground at a specific point—a stress fracture he had identified in the crater's surface, where reality seemed thinnest.

The effect was immediate and catastrophic. The fracture expanded explosively, connecting with the nearby fissure and causing it to widen dramatically. The ground between Feng Zhao and the vessel collapsed, creating a chasm that opened directly into the reality tear.

Feng Zhao's momentum carried him forward into empty space. His expression transformed from triumph to disbelief as he began to fall. In the last moment before the fissure claimed him, he lashed out with spiritual energy, a desperate attack aimed at Wei Liang.

The green energy whip caught Wei Liang across the chest, slicing through his robes and into flesh. Pain exploded through his body, driving the air from his lungs. He fell backward, blood soaking his robes, as Feng Zhao disappeared into the fissure with a final cry of rage and terror.

For several moments, Wei Liang lay on the shuddering ground, consciousness flickering as pain and blood loss threatened to overwhelm him. The array's collapse continued around him, reality breaking down in increasingly violent ways. If he remained, death was certain—either from his wounds or from the array's destruction.

With effort that sent fresh waves of agony through his body, Wei Liang rolled onto his stomach and began crawling toward the containment vessel. Each movement was torture, each breath a struggle against the damage to his chest. Blood trailed behind him, marking his path across the broken ground.

When he finally reached the vessel, he had barely enough strength to secure it to his back once more. The weight nearly drove him flat again, his injured body protesting the additional burden. But something beyond physical strength kept him moving—a determination born from a lifetime of enduring what should have broken him.

Wei Liang began the torturous journey toward the crater's edge, following the path he had identified earlier. The array's collapse had accelerated, pillars now completely detached from reality, floating and spinning in defiance of physics. The ground phased between solid and intangible, requiring careful timing for each step.

His vision began to narrow, darkness creeping in from the edges as blood loss took its toll. Still, he continued, one agonizing step after another. When he could no longer walk, he crawled. When crawling became impossible, he pulled himself forward by his fingertips, the containment vessel dragging behind him.

After what seemed like eternity, Wei Liang reached the crater's edge. He lay there, breath coming in ragged gasps, blood pooling beneath him. The containment vessel pulsed against his back, the node inside seeming to respond to his fading life force.

With the last of his strength, Wei Liang pulled himself over the edge, tumbling down the outer slope until he came to rest on relatively stable ground beyond the array's immediate influence. The sky above him shifted between day and night in rapid cycles, a visual representation of reality's damage in this place.

As consciousness began to slip away, Wei Liang became aware of a presence nearby—not physical, but a pressure against his mind. Something ancient and patient, watching him with interest. The containment vessel grew warm against his back, the node inside resonating with whatever observed him.

In his last moments of clarity, Wei Liang understood what was happening. The node had been more than a control component—it was a fragment of something sentient, something that had waited in the array since the divine war. And now, as his life ebbed away, it reached out to him.

*Empty vessel*, a voice whispered in his mind, though it used no language he recognized. *Hollow one. You who have been carved out by rejection and pain. You are suitable.*

Wei Liang tried to resist, some instinct warning him against whatever was happening. But his strength was gone, his will fading with his blood into the corrupted soil of the Shattered Wastes.

*Do not fight*, the voice continued. *You sought power. You sought recognition. I offer both, and more. All that was denied you shall be yours. All who denied you shall know your name and tremble.*

Darkness claimed the edges of Wei Liang's vision, his heartbeat slowing to a faint, erratic rhythm. In this moment between life and death, suspended in the broken reality of the Wastes, he made his final choice.

*Yes*, he thought, surrendering to the presence that reached for him. *Yes.*

The containment vessel shattered, formation arrays failing as the node inside exerted its full power. Crystalline shards pierced Wei Liang's back, but he felt no pain—only a cold rush as something ancient and terrible flowed into him through the wounds, filling the emptiness where a spirit root should have been.

His body arched, mouth opening in a silent scream as the foreign power rewrote him from within. Blood that had been flowing outward reversed direction, drawing back into his body along with the crystalline fragments, his wounds sealing not with healing but with transformation.

Above him, the chaotic sky stabilized momentarily, as if the very Wastes held their breath to witness what was occurring. Then darkness fell completely, not just over Wei Liang's vision but over the landscape itself, a void that spread outward from his transformed body.

When light returned, Wei Liang was gone. In his place lay something both more and less—a figure that resembled him in form but not in essence. Eyes that had once been human now held depths that reflected the void between stars. Skin that had been warm and alive now bore the faint translucence of fine porcelain, with hairline cracks visible beneath the surface.

The figure that had been Wei Liang sat up slowly, movements unnaturally fluid, as if joints and muscles operated according to different principles. It examined its hands with detached curiosity, turning them over to study the network of dark veins visible beneath the pale skin.

When it finally stood, the ground beneath its feet frosted over, reality itself recoiling from its touch. It looked back at the crater where the array continued its collapse, expression unreadable. Then it turned away, gaze fixing on the distant horizon where the Azure Peaks were just visible through the Wastes' distortion.

Something like a smile crossed its face—not an expression of joy, but of purpose found. Of vengeance awakened. Of power where once there had been only emptiness.

The Forgotten Path had found its disciple. And Wei Liang, the rootless nothing, had taken his first step toward becoming something the cultivation world would learn to fear.



# Chapter 4: The Void Between

Death was not what Wei Liang had expected.

There was no sudden darkness, no immediate release. Instead, consciousness ebbed and flowed like a tide against broken shores. One moment, he felt the sharp stones beneath his back, the next, nothing at all. His blood—warm then cold—pooled beneath him, seeping into the corrupted soil of the Shattered Wastes.

Pain came in waves. When present, it consumed everything—a symphony of agony as his body struggled against the inevitable. The wound across his chest burned as though Feng Zhao's spiritual attack still sliced through him, over and over, an endless loop of betrayal made physical.

Then, mercifully, the pain would recede, replaced by a floating sensation. In these moments, Wei Liang found himself elsewhere—or perhaps nowhere at all.

*Is this dying?* The thought drifted through his mind, detached and curious rather than frightened. *So slow. So... incomplete.*

Time lost meaning. The sky above him cycled through impossible colors—the fractured reality of the Wastes reflecting his fractured consciousness. Sometimes it appeared as normal daylight, other times as deepest night studded with stars that moved in patterns no astronomer had ever recorded. Occasionally, it became something else entirely—a swirling void that seemed to watch him with patient interest.

During one moment of clarity, Wei Liang tried to move. His body refused to respond, heavy and distant as though it belonged to someone else. Only his eyes obeyed, allowing him to see the extent of his situation. The containment vessel lay shattered beside him, crystalline shards scattered across the ground. The node it had held was nowhere to be seen, though the air around him shimmered with residual energy.

His robes were soaked through with blood—too much blood for anyone to survive losing. The rational part of his mind, still functioning despite everything, calculated that he should already be dead. That he remained conscious at all defied explanation.

Darkness claimed him again, deeper this time. When awareness returned, the quality of light had changed. How much time had passed? Hours? Days? In the Wastes, such distinctions meant little.

A sound reached him—not physical, but a vibration that resonated directly in his mind. It reminded him of the whispers he had heard when passing through the reality fissure, but clearer now, more focused. As if whatever spoke had found its intended audience.

*Empty vessel,* it seemed to say, though no words were actually spoken. *Hollow one.*

Wei Liang tried to respond but could form no words. His lips were cracked, his throat parched beyond function. Instead, he directed his thoughts toward the presence he sensed.

*Who are you?*

No answer came, but the air around him grew heavier, charged with potential. The shattered fragments of the containment vessel began to vibrate, tiny crystalline notes rising into a discordant melody.

Darkness claimed him once more.

When consciousness returned, Wei Liang found himself standing in the Azure Peaks Sect's main courtyard. The familiar stone paths and elegant buildings surrounded him, exactly as he remembered. Disciples moved about their daily routines—practicing formations, carrying supplies, hurrying to lessons.

None looked at him. None acknowledged his presence.

*A memory,* he realized. *Or a dying dream.*

He tried to touch a passing disciple, but his hand passed through the young man's shoulder like smoke. The sensation was disorienting—he could feel his body moving, yet it had no substance in this place.

Wei Liang wandered through the memory-sect, observing scenes from his life there. He saw himself as a child, newly arrived, sleeping in the servants' quarters with other orphans and castoffs. He watched his younger self carrying water, sweeping floors, enduring casual cruelty with downcast eyes.

The scenes shifted forward in time. He witnessed his unexpected elevation to outer disciple status, the confusion and resentment it generated among the other servants. He saw Master Jing examining him with clinical interest, making notes in a leather-bound book while young Wei Liang performed basic exercises that never produced a hint of spiritual energy.

*Why did you elevate me?* Wei Liang wondered, watching the elder's inscrutable face. *What were you looking for?*

The memory offered no answers, simply fading into another: Wei Liang in the sect library, secretly reading cultivation manuals by candlelight, memorizing meridian paths and energy circulation techniques he could never implement.

Each memory flowed into the next without clear transitions. He saw countless moments of humiliation at Feng Zhao's hands, each one burning with fresh pain despite the years that had passed. He witnessed his own stubborn persistence, the quiet defiance that had kept him going when surrender would have been easier.

Then came newer memories—the expedition preparations, the journey to the Wastes, the fateful moment when Feng Zhao's spiritual attack had torn through his chest.

The memories began to fragment, breaking apart like the shattered containment vessel. Pieces disappeared, leaving gaps in the narrative of his life. Wei Liang tried to hold onto them, suddenly desperate not to lose these parts of himself, but they slipped away like water through cupped hands.

*No,* he thought, reaching for a fading image of his first day in the sect. *Don't take that. It's mine.*

*Is it?* The voice that wasn't a voice returned, resonating through the dissolving memories. *What use are such things to one who walks the Forgotten Path?*

The courtyard scene shattered completely, replaced by darkness so absolute it seemed to have substance. Wei Liang felt himself falling through it, or perhaps it was falling through him—direction had no meaning in this void.

*What is happening to me?* he asked the darkness.

*Transformation,* came the reply. *The vessel breaks so that it may be filled.*

Before Wei Liang could question this cryptic answer, the darkness receded. He found himself in a new location—not a memory this time, but somewhere he had never been.

A vast chamber stretched around him, its walls, floor, and ceiling formed from the same crystalline material as the node from the array. The space pulsed with energy that flowed in visible currents, like rivers of light streaming through the air. At the center stood a formation array far more complex than the one they had found in the Wastes—a perfect circle of pillars surrounding a raised platform.

Upon the platform stood figures that defied description. They were humanoid in basic shape, but their forms shifted constantly, as if reality itself couldn't decide on their appearance. They moved with purpose, manipulating the energy currents, shaping them into patterns that hurt Wei Liang's mind to observe.

*The forgotten gods,* he realized with sudden certainty. *Before the cataclysm. Before they were forgotten.*

He was witnessing something impossible—a moment from before the divine war, preserved somehow in the corrupted reality of the Wastes. Or perhaps created by his dying mind as it struggled to make sense of what was happening to him.

One of the figures paused in its work, turning toward Wei Liang as if sensing his presence across the vast gulf of time. Its face—if it could be called a face—seemed to focus, features resolving momentarily into something almost human.

It spoke, and though Wei Liang couldn't hear the words, he felt their meaning imprint directly upon his consciousness:

*We created the paths to ascension, the methods by which lesser beings might approach our state. But for every path forged, a shadow path forms—an inverse, a reflection. We hid these shadow paths, for they lead to power through destruction rather than creation.*

The figure's form began to blur again, its momentary clarity fading.

*The Forgotten Path is one such shadow. It consumes rather than builds. It empties rather than fills. It breaks rather than forges. And yet, in breaking, it creates something new—something that should not be.*

The vision began to dissolve, the crystalline chamber breaking apart into fragments that swirled around Wei Liang like a storm.

*Why show me this?* Wei Liang asked as the fragments closed in around him.

*You have already chosen,* came the reply, though whether from the figure or from somewhere else, he couldn't tell. *I merely show you what your choice means.*

The fragments struck him all at once, a thousand crystalline shards piercing his form. There was no pain—his body wasn't really here, after all—but he felt each entry as a cold shock, like plunging into winter water. The shards didn't stop at his skin but continued inward, replacing blood and bone and tissue with their crystalline substance.

Wei Liang tried to scream, but his mouth was gone, replaced by the same crystal that now formed the rest of him. For a moment, he was aware of himself as something inhuman—a crystalline statue in the shape of a man, hollow inside, waiting to be filled.

Then even that awareness shattered.

He fell back into his broken body on the corrupted soil of the Wastes. Pain returned, but different now—not the sharp agony of a wound, but the deep ache of transformation. His blood no longer flowed outward but seemed to be changing within his veins, becoming something else entirely.

The sky above had settled into perpetual twilight, neither day nor night but the boundary between them. Wei Liang found he could see more clearly in this half-light than he ever had in full day—details that should have been lost in shadow were perfectly visible, as if darkness itself had become a lens rather than an obscurement.

*Get up.*

The command came from within and without simultaneously—his own thought and something else's, indistinguishable from each other. His body, which had been unresponsive for what felt like eternity, suddenly obeyed. Muscles that should have been too damaged to function contracted smoothly. Limbs that should have been stiff with rigor moved with fluid grace.

Wei Liang stood, looking down at himself with detached curiosity. The wound across his chest remained, but it no longer bled. Instead, the edges had sealed with something that resembled frost, tiny crystalline structures binding the torn flesh together. His robes, stiff with dried blood, cracked and flaked as he moved, revealing skin beneath that was paler than it should have been, with a faint translucence like fine porcelain.

He raised a hand to his face, fingers exploring features that felt both familiar and strange. His cheeks were hollowed, his eyes sunken deeper into their sockets. When he touched his chest, he felt no heartbeat—or rather, he felt something pulsing, but at a rhythm too slow and irregular to sustain human life.

*What am I becoming?* he wondered, the question directed at both himself and the presence he still sensed within him.

*The first disciple of the Forgotten Path in an age,* came the reply. *The vessel through which the forgotten shall return to memory.*

Wei Liang looked around, seeing the Shattered Wastes with new eyes. The corruption and distortion that had seemed so alien before now appeared almost beautiful—a canvas of possibility where reality could be rewritten. The very wrongness of this place resonated with the wrongness now growing within him.

He took a step, then another, testing this new body that was his yet not entirely his. Movement came easily, too easily—as if gravity had less hold on him than before. The ground beneath his feet frosted slightly where he stepped, tiny crystals forming and then sublimating back into the air.

A sound caught his attention—a distant cry of pain or fear. Wei Liang turned toward it, his senses extending beyond normal human range. He could perceive the source: a group of disciples, Azure Peaks by their robes, moving cautiously through the Wastes perhaps half a mile away. A search party, he realized. Looking for survivors. Looking for the artifact.

Looking for him.

Something stirred within Wei Liang at the sight of those familiar robes—a complex emotion that took him a moment to identify. Not quite anger, not quite hatred, but a cold, implacable purpose. These were Feng Zhao's people. The ones who had left him to die. The ones who upheld a system that had deemed him worthless from birth.

*They will not recognize you now,* the voice within him suggested. *You could approach. Listen. Learn.*

Wei Liang considered this. Part of him—the calculating survivor who had endured years of abuse at the sect—appreciated the tactical advantage. But another part, the part that was rapidly becoming dominant, wanted something else entirely.

He wanted them to know exactly who he was. He wanted to see the recognition in their eyes, followed by the fear. He wanted them to understand that the rootless nothing they had discarded had returned as something terrible.

*Patience,* the voice counseled. *You are newly born to this path. Your power is but a fraction of what it will become.*

Reluctantly, Wei Liang acknowledged the wisdom in this. He was changed, yes, but still vulnerable. Still learning what he had become. The time for confrontation would come, but not yet.

He turned away from the search party, moving deeper into the Wastes. Each step felt more natural than the last as he adjusted to his transformed body. The pain had faded entirely now, replaced by a strange hollowness—an emptiness at his core that somehow didn't feel like absence but like potential.

As he walked, Wei Liang became aware of another sensation: hunger. Not physical hunger for food—he suspected his body no longer required such sustenance—but a deeper, more fundamental craving. A hunger for something he couldn't name but could sense all around him in the corrupted energy of the Wastes.

Instinctively, he reached out with senses he hadn't possessed before, drawing some of that energy toward him. It came willingly, almost eagerly, flowing into the emptiness within him like water into a vessel. The sensation was intoxicating—a rush of power unlike anything he had experienced in his previous life.

For someone who had been denied spiritual energy his entire existence, who had been told repeatedly that he lacked the fundamental capacity to cultivate, this moment was revelation. The irony wasn't lost on him: he had finally found a path to power, but only after being broken beyond repair.

*Not broken,* the voice corrected. *Emptied. The rootless are rare and precious—vessels without predetermined shape, capable of holding what others cannot.*

Wei Liang absorbed this information as he continued walking, putting distance between himself and the search party. The landscape around him grew increasingly distorted—reality fissures more frequent, gravity more variable, time flowing at inconsistent rates. None of these phenomena bothered him now. If anything, he felt more at home in these broken spaces than he ever had in the ordered world of the sect.

He came to a place where a reality fissure had torn open a permanent gap between locations. Through it, he could see a different part of the Wastes—a valley filled with crystalline formations similar to the node from the array. The sight triggered a resonance within him, a recognition that drew him forward.

Wei Liang stepped through the fissure without hesitation, experiencing a momentary sensation of being everywhere and nowhere simultaneously before emerging on the other side. The valley spread before him, glittering in the perpetual twilight. At its center stood a single structure—not a building in the conventional sense, but a formation of crystal that had grown into the rough shape of a pavilion.

He approached it, drawn by an instinct he didn't fully understand. As he drew closer, he saw that the crystalline structure was covered in script—the same ancient writing that had adorned the array and the containment vessel. Here, however, the script was more extensive, forming complete passages rather than fragmentary phrases.

Wei Liang reached out, fingers tracing the symbols. To his surprise, he could understand them—not through knowledge of the language, but through a direct comprehension that bypassed normal translation. The writing described the Forgotten Path in detail—its origins, its stages, its powers and costs.

*The First Hollowing,* he read. *The vessel is emptied through trauma, creating space for the void to enter. The body survives while the self begins to erode. The Hollowborn can absorb minor spiritual attacks, conceal their presence from spiritual senses, and convert pain to power.*

Wei Liang recognized his current state in this description. The Hollowborn—the first stage of the Forgotten Path. The beginning of a journey that would transform him further with each step.

He continued reading, learning of the stages that awaited him: Fracture, Void, Unmaker, and finally, the Nameless. Each promised greater power, and each demanded greater sacrifice—memories, identity, humanity itself.

The price was high. But as Wei Liang stood in the valley of crystals, the emptiness within him hungering for fulfillment, he found he did not care. What use was humanity to one who had been treated as less than human? What value were memories of pain and rejection? What worth was an identity forged in the crucible of others' contempt?

He had been Wei Liang, the rootless disciple, the eternal servant, the expendable tool. That person had died in the Wastes, betrayed by those he had served faithfully.

What rose in his place would be something else entirely. Something that would make Feng Zhao and the Azure Peaks Sect remember the one they had tried to forget.

As this resolution crystallized within him, Wei Liang felt a shift in his transformed body. The emptiness at his core pulsed, responding to his determination. The script on the crystalline pavilion began to glow, resonating with the same energy.

*The Path recognizes its disciple,* the voice within him observed. *Now begins your true cultivation.*

Wei Liang raised his hands before his face, watching as the veins beneath his translucent skin darkened, carrying something that was no longer blood through his transformed body. The frost-like substance that had sealed his chest wound spread slightly, forming patterns like branching crystals across his skin.

He closed his eyes, turning his awareness inward as he had practiced countless times while studying forbidden cultivation manuals. But where those attempts had always met with failure—the absence of a spirit root preventing any circulation of energy—now he found something responding.

Not a core of energy forming in his dantian, as traditional cultivation would create, but rather a controlled emptiness—a void that could draw in and consume energy from outside himself. The opposite of traditional cultivation, which generated power from within. The Forgotten Path instead devoured power from without.

Wei Liang opened his eyes, seeing the world differently yet again. Energy patterns were visible to him now—currents and eddies of spiritual power flowing through the corrupted landscape of the Wastes. Some were bright and pure, others twisted and distorted, but all were potentially his to consume.

He extended his awareness, testing this new perception. In the distance, he could sense the search party from Azure Peaks more clearly now—not just their physical presence but the glow of their cultivation. Each disciple shone like a lantern in his enhanced perception, their carefully cultivated spiritual energy a beacon that both attracted and repelled him.

The hunger within him surged at the sight, urging him to approach, to consume, to devour the power they had built over years of privileged cultivation. It would be so easy to ambush a straggler, to feed this new emptiness with stolen energy.

*Not yet,* Wei Liang told himself, forcing the hunger back. *Not until I understand what I've become. Not until I can make them understand what they've created.*

He turned away from the temptation, focusing instead on the crystalline pavilion and its ancient knowledge. Here, in this forgotten place, he would learn. He would master this inverse path of cultivation. He would embrace the emptiness and the hunger, turning them from weaknesses into weapons.

And when he was ready—when the rootless nothing had become something terrible and powerful—he would return to those who had discarded him. Not for mere revenge, but for recognition. To force them to see what their actions had wrought. To make them remember what they had tried to forget.

In the perpetual twilight of the Shattered Wastes, Wei Liang—or what had once been Wei Liang—began his study of the Forgotten Path. The first disciple in an age of a cultivation method that should have remained lost. The empty vessel now being filled with something ancient and ruinous.

Above him, the fractured sky continued its impossible cycles, indifferent to the transformation occurring below. Around him, the corrupted landscape of the Wastes pulsed with energies that resonated with his new nature. And within him, the voice that was both his and not his whispered secrets of power that no living cultivator remembered.

The void between life and death, between human and other, between forgotten and remembered—this was where Wei Liang now existed. And from this liminal space, he would forge a path that would shake the foundations of the cultivation world.

One empty step at a time.



# Chapter 5: Hollowborn

The search party from Azure Peaks Sect moved through the Shattered Wastes like frightened children, huddled together in tight formation, spiritual energy flaring at every unexpected sound. Wei Liang watched them from the shadow of a crystalline outcropping, his newly awakened senses perceiving their fear as clearly as he saw their faces.

Three days had passed since his transformation—or perhaps it had been longer. Time flowed strangely in the Wastes, and stranger still in his altered perception. He had spent these days learning the limits of his new form, testing abilities that would have been impossible in his previous life.

The emptiness within him had grown familiar, a constant hunger that whispered for fulfillment. He had fed it small portions—corrupted energy from the Wastes, ambient spiritual residue from the ancient battlefield—but these were mere morsels. Unsatisfying. The true feast, his instincts told him, would be the cultivated energy of living disciples.

Wei Liang shifted position, moving with unnatural silence. His body felt lighter now, disconnected from normal physical constraints. The wound across his chest had fully sealed, leaving a crystalline scar that occasionally pulsed with dark energy. His skin had grown paler, taking on a translucent quality that revealed shadowed veins beneath. His eyes, when he had glimpsed their reflection in a pool of still water, had become unnaturally deep-set, almost sunken, with an intensity that hadn't been there before.

The Hollowborn. First stage of the Forgotten Path.

The search party paused at a junction where three paths converged. Wei Liang recognized their leader—Disciple Chen, the youngest of the inner disciples who had accompanied Feng Zhao on the expedition. The one who had occasionally shown him small kindnesses. The one who had warned him before they entered the Wastes.

"We've searched this quadrant for three days," one of the other disciples was saying, voice tight with strain. "If Wei Liang survived, we would have found some trace by now."

"Elder Shen's orders were clear," Chen replied, his expression troubled. "We must confirm his status, one way or another."

"He was cut down by Senior Brother Feng," another disciple argued. "No one could survive such a wound, especially not a rootless disciple with no cultivation."

Wei Liang felt a cold amusement at their certainty. How little they understood about survival. About adaptation. About the power that could be found in emptiness.

"And the artifact?" Chen asked, changing the subject. "Any sign of the containment vessel?"

The disciples exchanged uneasy glances. "Nothing. The array site is completely destabilized. Reality fissures have made thorough exploration impossible."

Chen's face hardened. "Elder Shen won't be pleased. That artifact was the mission's primary objective."

"Senior Brother Feng said the vessel was lost when Wei Liang tried to flee with it," one disciple offered. "Perhaps it was pulled into a fissure."

The lie hung in the air, obvious even to those who hadn't witnessed the truth. Wei Liang wondered if Feng Zhao had made it back to the sect, or if the reality fissure had claimed him permanently. The thought brought neither satisfaction nor disappointment—just a detached curiosity.

"We'll make one final sweep toward the eastern boundary," Chen decided. "If we find nothing by nightfall, we return to the sect."

The disciples nodded, relief evident in their postures. None of them wanted to remain in the Wastes any longer than necessary. The corruption here affected even those with strong cultivation, subtle distortions of perception and thought that grew more pronounced with exposure.

Wei Liang waited until they had moved a sufficient distance away before emerging from his hiding place. He could follow them easily—his new senses could track the glow of their spiritual energy even beyond visual range—but direct confrontation served no purpose yet. Better to observe. To learn. To plan.

He turned instead toward the crystalline pavilion he had claimed as his temporary sanctuary. The ancient structure had become his dwelling and his teacher, its inscriptions revealing secrets of the Forgotten Path that no living cultivator remembered. Each day, he absorbed more knowledge, understanding more fully what he was becoming.

The pavilion stood in the center of the crystal valley, its translucent walls catching the perpetual twilight and refracting it into impossible colors. As Wei Liang approached, he felt the structure respond to his presence—a subtle resonance between the emptiness within him and the ancient power contained in the crystals.

He entered through an archway that had no door, moving into the main chamber where the densest concentration of inscriptions covered the walls. The space felt both alien and familiar now, a reflection of his own transformed state.

Wei Liang settled into a cross-legged position at the chamber's center, closing his eyes and turning his awareness inward. The emptiness at his core pulsed in response, a void that hungered for fulfillment. He had learned to control this hunger somewhat, to direct it rather than being directed by it, but the effort required constant vigilance.

According to the inscriptions, the Hollowborn stage was merely the beginning—the emptying that created space for what was to come. To progress further along the Forgotten Path, he would need to consume cultivated spiritual energy directly from its source. He would need to feed on those who had what he had been denied.

The thought should have disturbed him. In his previous life, he had clung to whatever scraps of morality he could afford—small kindnesses, minor principles that separated him from true monsters. But that person had died in the Wastes, betrayed and abandoned. What rose in his place viewed morality as just another luxury denied to the rootless.

A sound from outside the pavilion broke his meditation—a crystalline chime that served as warning. Something approached. Something powerful.

Wei Liang rose fluidly, moving to the archway with preternatural speed. Outside, the twilight had deepened, shadows stretching across the valley floor. Among those shadows moved a figure that seemed composed of darkness itself—a woman-shaped absence that absorbed light rather than reflecting it.

He watched her approach, neither hiding nor revealing himself. His new senses extended, trying to gauge her nature, but encountered only a void similar to his own—an emptiness that hunger couldn't penetrate.

The figure stopped at the base of the pavilion steps, head tilted upward as if examining the structure. When she spoke, her voice had an echo quality, as if reaching him from a great distance despite her proximity.

"The Forgotten Path finds a new disciple," she said, the words neither question nor greeting but simple observation. "How unexpected."

Wei Liang stepped fully into the archway, allowing himself to be seen. "Who are you?"

The figure's form shifted slightly, darkness flowing like liquid. "Names have power, Hollowborn. I surrendered mine long ago." She gestured at herself. "Those who notice me at all call me the Hollow Woman. It serves well enough."

The title resonated with Wei Liang's new knowledge. The inscriptions had mentioned others who had walked the Forgotten Path in ages past—most driven mad by the transformation, a few achieving terrible power before being destroyed by those who upheld the traditional cultivation order.

"You walk the same path," he said, recognizing the similarity in their emptiness.

"Walked," she corrected. "I reached its end long ago, then turned back from the final threshold. Now I merely exist in the spaces between, neither progressing nor regressing."

Wei Liang descended the pavilion steps, closing the distance between them. As he drew nearer, he could see that her form wasn't truly featureless—within the darkness were suggestions of a face, limbs, clothing. Like a person viewed through deep water, details obscured but presence undeniable.

"Why turn back?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's laugh held no humor. "The final stage requires complete surrender of self. I discovered, too late, that I valued what remained of mine." Her form shifted again, darkness coalescing into slightly greater definition. "But you didn't invite me to your philosophical discussion. I came uninvited."

"Why?"

"Curiosity," she said. "It has been centuries since anyone new walked this path. The traditional cultivation sects have been... thorough in their suppression of knowledge."

Wei Liang considered this. The inscriptions had hinted at systematic destruction of information about the Forgotten Path, but hearing confirmation from one who had witnessed it firsthand gave the knowledge new weight.

"They fear what they cannot control," he said.

"With good reason." The Hollow Woman gestured at the valley around them. "The Forgotten Path consumes. It breaks. It unmakes. The traditional paths build and refine—they create stability. We..." She paused. "We create change through destruction. Few civilizations welcome such force within their borders."

Wei Liang absorbed this, finding no argument against her assessment. The hunger within him didn't care for stability or civilization—it wanted only to consume, to grow stronger through the absorption of others' power.

"You didn't answer my first question," he said. "Why are you here? Mere curiosity seems insufficient motivation."

The darkness around her rippled, an equivalent of a shrug perhaps. "The Wastes preserve what should be forgotten. I am its most faithful guardian in that respect." She studied him with eyes he couldn't see but could feel. "When something new emerges—something that walks between traditional cultivation and true corruption—I take notice."

"And then?"

"That depends on you, Hollowborn." She moved closer, her form flowing rather than stepping. "What do you seek from this path? Power? Revenge? Transcendence?"

The question struck deeper than Wei Liang expected. In the days since his transformation, he had focused on survival and understanding, not ultimate purpose. The hunger provided direction but not meaning.

"Recognition," he finally said, the word emerging from some place deeper than thought. "To be seen. To matter. To force those who deemed me nothing to acknowledge what I've become."

The Hollow Woman was silent for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice held a new quality—something almost like sympathy, though filtered through centuries of detachment.

"A dangerous purpose," she said. "More dangerous than you know."

"Why?"

"Because it keeps you bound to them. To their judgment. To their values." Her form expanded slightly, darkness spreading like ink in water. "The true power of the Forgotten Path comes when you no longer care what others see when they look at you."

Wei Liang felt resistance rise within him—not from the hunger, but from the remnants of the person he had been. The servant boy who had endured countless humiliations while dreaming of the day his worth would be recognized. The rootless disciple who had memorized cultivation techniques he could never perform, hoping somehow to transcend his limitations.

"Then what purpose would you suggest?" he asked, unable to keep a edge from his voice.

"I suggest nothing," she replied. "I merely observe that purposes, like names, can become chains. The Forgotten Path offers freedom from such constraints—but only if you're willing to forget what bound you in the first place."

Before Wei Liang could respond, a distant sound caught his attention—voices carried on the wind, approaching from the valley's edge. The search party had changed direction, now moving toward their location.

The Hollow Woman noticed his shift in attention. "Ah. Your former sect-mates approach. Will you hide again, or will you show them what you've become?"

The question wasn't mocking but seemed genuinely curious. Wei Liang considered his options. He was stronger than before, but still new to his abilities. Confronting multiple cultivators, even with the element of surprise, carried significant risk.

"I'm not ready," he admitted, the words difficult to speak.

"Wisdom rare in the newly transformed," the Hollow Woman noted with what might have been approval. "Come. I know paths through the Wastes that even the search parties won't find."

She turned, flowing toward a narrow gap between crystal formations. Wei Liang hesitated only briefly before following. The pavilion had taught him much, but a living guide who had walked the same path offered knowledge of a different kind.

They moved through the crystal valley in silence, the Hollow Woman leading him along routes that seemed to shift as they traversed them—paths that existed in the spaces between stable reality. Wei Liang found he could navigate these liminal spaces with increasing ease, his transformed nature resonating with their instability.

The voices of the search party faded behind them as they entered a region of the Wastes he hadn't explored before. Here, the corruption manifested differently—not in obvious distortions of physics or reality, but in subtle wrongness that was almost more disturbing. Trees that looked normal until one noticed they cast no shadows. Rocks that remained perfectly dry despite the stream flowing over them. Birds that flew in place, never advancing despite their beating wings.

"The Quiet Wastes," the Hollow Woman explained without being asked. "Where corruption turns inward rather than outward. Few cultivators venture here—the distortions are harder to detect until it's too late."

"Too late for what?" Wei Liang asked.

"For them to realize their own cultivation has been inverted." Her form seemed to smile, though he couldn't see her face clearly. "A cultivator might spend hours here, believing they're strengthening their core, only to discover they've been systematically dismantling it instead."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. "But we're immune?"

"Not immune. Compatible." She gestured at their surroundings. "The Forgotten Path is itself an inversion—consumption rather than generation, emptying rather than filling. The corruption here operates on similar principles."

They continued through the Quiet Wastes until they reached a clearing where a single structure stood—a small cottage that appeared ordinary except for the fact that it was constructed entirely upside-down, its roof serving as floor, its door accessible only by walking up walls that functioned as ground.

The Hollow Woman flowed up the inverted wall without difficulty. Wei Liang followed more cautiously, discovering that his body responded to his intention rather than normal physics. Gravity reoriented as he moved, making the impossible transition feel natural.

Inside, the cottage was larger than its exterior suggested—another spatial distortion that no longer surprised him. Furnishings were minimal and strange: chairs that faced walls, tables with objects affixed to their undersides, windows that showed scenes from places that couldn't possibly be visible from this location.

"My dwelling," the Hollow Woman said, her form settling into a more defined shape in these familiar surroundings. "One of several I maintain throughout the Wastes."

Wei Liang examined the space with interest. "You've lived here long?"

"Time is flexible in the Wastes," she replied, "but yes, by any meaningful measure. Since before the Azure Peaks Sect existed. Since before most of the current cultivation world took shape."

The casual mention of such vast timeframes gave Wei Liang pause. The inscriptions had hinted at the longevity granted by the Forgotten Path, but hearing it confirmed made the reality more concrete.

"How far did you progress?" he asked. "Before turning back from the final threshold?"

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely, darkness condensing until he could almost make out features—a woman's face, ageless and severe, with eyes that held no color but infinite depth.

"The Unmaker," she said. "Fourth stage. One step from the Nameless."

Wei Liang recalled the inscriptions describing these advanced stages. The Unmaker could corrupt reality itself, rewriting small aspects of the world through sheer will. Such power seemed godlike, yet she spoke of it with what sounded like regret.

"And now?" he asked.

"Now I exist between stages. Neither advancing nor retreating." Her form expanded again, features fading back into darkness. "The price of indecision."

Wei Liang sensed there was more to her story—centuries of existence compressed into those simple statements—but he didn't press. Instead, he turned his attention to more immediate concerns.

"The search party will report back to the sect soon," he said. "They'll declare me dead if they haven't already."

"And is that not advantageous?" the Hollow Woman asked. "To be forgotten by those who would hunt you? To have time to grow stronger without interference?"

"Perhaps," Wei Liang conceded. "But it feels like..." He struggled to articulate the discomfort. "Like they win. Like Feng Zhao's betrayal succeeds."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been a sigh. "You remain bound to their recognition, even now. Even after the Path has begun to transform you." She moved closer, her darkness cool against his skin. "Let me show you something."

She gestured, and one of the windows changed its view, no longer showing an impossible landscape but a scene Wei Liang recognized—the Azure Peaks Sect's main hall. Within it stood Elder Shen, severe and imposing, addressing a group that included Feng Zhao.

"How—" Wei Liang began.

"The Wastes connect to many places," the Hollow Woman explained. "With sufficient understanding, one can glimpse through these connections. Listen."

Sound accompanied the image now, Elder Shen's voice crisp and authoritative: "...no confirmation of death, but given the circumstances, we must assume Disciple Wei did not survive. The containment vessel and artifact are also lost. This expedition has failed in its primary objective."

Feng Zhao bowed, his expression appropriately solemn. "This disciple takes full responsibility. The array's destabilization was more severe than anticipated. Wei Liang panicked and fled with the vessel despite my orders to remain in formation. When I pursued, a reality fissure opened between us. I was fortunate to escape with my life."

The lie was delivered with perfect conviction, not a hint of the truth showing in Feng Zhao's face or voice. Wei Liang felt a cold rage building within him, the hunger in his core responding to his emotions, growing sharper and more insistent.

Elder Shen's expression revealed nothing of her thoughts. "The loss of the artifact is regrettable. The loss of a disciple, even one without cultivation potential, is a failure of leadership." Her gaze fixed on Feng Zhao. "You will meditate on this failure for thirty days in the Reflection Chamber. Perhaps isolation will improve your judgment."

Feng Zhao's composure slipped momentarily, shock and indignation flashing across his features before he mastered himself. "Yes, Elder. This disciple accepts correction."

The window's view faded, returning to its previous impossible landscape. Wei Liang stood motionless, absorbing what he had witnessed. The casual dismissal of his supposed death. The easy acceptance of Feng Zhao's lies. The concern for the artifact that outweighed any concern for a disciple's life.

"They are exactly as you remember them," the Hollow Woman observed. "Does this surprise you?"

"No," Wei Liang admitted. "But seeing it confirms what I already knew."

"And what will you do with this confirmation?"

Wei Liang turned away from the window, facing the darkness that was his unexpected guide. "Grow stronger. Master this path. And then return to show them exactly what they created when they left me to die."

The Hollow Woman's form shifted, darkness rippling with what might have been amusement or concern. "A predictable response. But not an unworthy one, provided you remember that revenge is merely a beginning, not an end."

"What comes after revenge?" Wei Liang asked.

"That," she said, "is the question that will determine whether you become merely another horror of the Wastes, or something truly transcendent." Her form moved toward the inverted door. "But such philosophical matters can wait. First, you must master the practical aspects of your transformation."

Wei Liang followed her outside, back into the Quiet Wastes where reality turned subtly inward. "You'll teach me?"

"I will show you what I can," she replied. "The rest, you must learn through experience. The Forgotten Path cannot be taught like traditional cultivation—it must be lived, suffered, embraced."

She led him to a small clearing where the inversion of reality was particularly strong. Here, spiritual energy flowed in reverse patterns, cycling inward rather than outward, collapsing rather than expanding.

"The Hollowborn stage focuses on absorption and concealment," she explained. "You must learn to control what you consume and how you appear to others. Begin by extending your awareness—feel the energy around you."

Wei Liang closed his eyes, reaching out with his new senses. The corrupted spiritual energy of the Wastes swirled around him, chaotic and potent. He could perceive it more clearly now than during his first days after transformation—distinct currents and eddies, each with different qualities and intensities.

"Good," the Hollow Woman said, observing him with senses he couldn't comprehend. "Now, draw some of that energy toward you—not all at once, but in a controlled stream. Imagine the emptiness within you as a vessel with a narrow opening, allowing only what you choose to enter."

Wei Liang focused on a nearby current of energy—one that felt less corrupted than others, closer to natural spiritual energy. He extended his awareness toward it, feeling the hunger within him respond eagerly. Too eagerly. The energy rushed toward him in a flood rather than a stream, threatening to overwhelm his control.

"Restraint," the Hollow Woman cautioned. "The Path will always hunger for more than you intend to take. You must impose your will upon it, not merely channel its power."

Wei Liang struggled, fighting to narrow the connection between himself and the energy current. Slowly, with great effort, he managed to reduce the flow to a manageable stream. The energy entered the emptiness within him, cool and potent, filling a small portion of the void.

"Better," she acknowledged. "Though still crude. With practice, you'll develop finer control."

They continued this exercise for hours, Wei Liang learning to select specific energy currents, to control the rate of absorption, to process different types of spiritual essence. The work was exhausting in a way physical training had never been—it taxed something deeper than muscles or breath, straining against the limits of his transformed being.

When they finally paused, the perpetual twilight of the Wastes had shifted toward deeper shadow, indicating the passage of time despite the absence of true night or day.

"You learn quickly," the Hollow Woman observed. "Most new to the Path struggle for weeks to achieve what you've managed in hours."

Wei Liang sensed this wasn't mere flattery. "Why?"

"Your previous emptiness prepared you," she said. "Those who come to the Path from traditional cultivation must unlearn before they can learn. You have less to unlearn."

A bitter irony—his greatest disadvantage in his previous life had become an advantage in his new existence. The absence of a spirit root, which had prevented him from gathering and circulating spiritual energy in the traditional manner, now allowed him to more easily adapt to a path that operated on opposite principles.

"What else must I learn?" he asked.

"Patience," she replied, amusement coloring her echoing voice. "Even the Forgotten Path requires time. But next, we should address concealment. The ability to hide your nature from those who would recognize it as anathema."

She led him to another area of the Quiet Wastes, where the boundary between corrupted and uncorrupted reality was more distinct. Here, normal spiritual energy occasionally flowed in from outside the Wastes, creating pockets of relative stability.

"Traditional cultivators sense others through their spiritual energy," the Hollow Woman explained. "They perceive the presence, strength, and nature of cultivation. What do you think they will sense when they encounter you?"

Wei Liang considered this. "Emptiness. Absence. A void where cultivation should be."

"Precisely. And nothing draws attention like an absence where something should exist." Her form shifted, darkness condensing until she appeared almost solid—a woman in gray robes, her features still indistinct but her form recognizably human. "The Hollowborn can conceal this emptiness, presenting a false front to spiritual senses."

She demonstrated, her presence in his spiritual perception changing from a void to something unremarkable—a minor cultivator of no particular strength or distinction. Someone easily overlooked, easily forgotten.

"How?" Wei Liang asked, fascinated by the transformation.

"By creating a shell of absorbed energy around your core emptiness," she explained, her form returning to its natural void state. "A thin layer that mimics normal cultivation, hiding the hunger beneath."

Wei Liang attempted to replicate the technique, drawing on the energy he had absorbed earlier. Shaping it proved difficult—like trying to form water into a specific shape with bare hands. His first attempts dissipated quickly, the energy either being consumed by his core emptiness or dispersing back into the environment.

"Intention is key," the Hollow Woman advised. "The energy responds to your will, but that will must be precise and sustained."

Wei Liang tried again, focusing more intently on the image he wished to project—a minor cultivator, unremarkable and unthreatening. This time, the energy responded better, forming a thin shell around his emptiness. It felt strange, like wearing a garment made of light, but it held.

"Now move," she instructed. "Maintain the shell while in motion."

This proved even more challenging. With each step, the energy shell threatened to collapse, requiring constant attention to maintain. Wei Liang persisted, gradually developing a divided awareness—one part focused inward on maintaining the disguise, another part engaged with the external world.

"This will become easier with practice," the Hollow Woman assured him. "Eventually, you'll maintain such concealment without conscious thought, as naturally as breathing."

They continued training until Wei Liang could maintain his false appearance while performing basic movements and interactions. By the end, exhaustion had settled deep into his being—not physical fatigue, but a spiritual depletion that made the hunger within him sharper, more demanding.

"Enough for today," the Hollow Woman decided, observing his state with her unseen eyes. "You need to rest and integrate what you've learned."

She led him back to the inverted cottage, where she indicated a space he could use for meditation. Wei Liang settled into a cross-legged position, closing his eyes and turning his awareness inward as he had done countless times in his previous life. The practice felt both familiar and utterly different now—where once he had found only frustration and limitation, now he found the controlled emptiness of his transformed core.

As he meditated, Wei Liang reflected on the day's training and the path that stretched before him. The Hollow Woman had shown him only the most basic techniques of the Hollowborn stage, yet even these exceeded anything he could have achieved as a rootless disciple. And beyond the Hollowborn lay further stages, each promising greater power at greater cost.

The hunger within him pulsed at these thoughts, eager for advancement, for consumption, for growth. Wei Liang acknowledged it without surrendering to it. Control, the Hollow Woman had emphasized. Restraint. Patience. The Path would always demand more than was wise to give.

His meditation deepened, consciousness expanding to encompass his transformed being more fully. He could sense the changes more precisely now—the crystalline structures forming within his flesh, the altered pathways where blood had once flowed, the hollow spaces where organs had been repurposed or rendered unnecessary. His body was becoming a vessel for something other than life as traditionally understood.

In this deepened awareness, Wei Liang also sensed something he hadn't noticed before—a subtle connection extending from his core emptiness outward, beyond his physical form. He followed this connection with his perception, tracing it through the corrupted reality of the Wastes, through layers of distortion and displacement, until he found its destination.

The array. Or what remained of it.

Though physically distant, the connection made it feel immediate, as if he could reach out and touch the destabilized formation. Through this link, he sensed that the array continued its collapse, reality around it fracturing further with each passing day. And at its center, where the node had been extracted, a wound in reality itself pulsed in rhythm with the emptiness inside him.

Wei Liang pulled his awareness back, disturbed by the implications. The node hadn't simply transformed him—it had connected him to the array, to the wound its removal had created. He was linked to the very source of the Wastes' corruption.

He opened his eyes, intending to ask the Hollow Woman about this discovery, but found the cottage empty. His mysterious guide had departed while he meditated, leaving him alone with his questions.

Outside, the perpetual twilight had shifted again, suggesting the passage of hours. Wei Liang emerged from the inverted structure, reorienting himself to the Quiet Wastes. His senses extended, searching for the Hollow Woman's distinctive void presence, but found nothing. She had gone beyond his perception's range.

Alone again. As he had always been, in truth, despite years surrounded by the sect's disciples and servants. The realization brought neither pain nor comfort—merely acknowledgment of a constant in his existence.

Wei Liang considered his options. He could wait for the Hollow Woman's return, assuming she intended to continue his training. Or he could explore further on his own, testing his new abilities and expanding his understanding of the Wastes.

The hunger within him suggested a third option—to seek out living cultivators, to consume their energy directly rather than absorbing ambient spiritual essence. The search party had departed, but others would come. The Azure Peaks Sect wouldn't abandon their interest in the Wastes entirely, not with valuable artifacts still potentially recoverable.

Wei Liang rejected this option for now. He was still too new to his powers, too uncertain of his control. Better to continue learning, to master what he had already gained before seeking more.

He decided to return to the crystal valley and the pavilion where he had first learned of the Forgotten Path. The inscriptions there might provide insight into the connection he had discovered during meditation.

Moving through the Quiet Wastes proved easier than before, his body adapting further to the inverted reality with each passing hour. He maintained the concealment technique the Hollow Woman had taught him, practicing the divided awareness necessary to sustain it while navigating the corrupted landscape.

As he traveled, Wei Liang encountered other denizens of the Wastes—creatures transformed by prolonged exposure to corruption, neither fully animal nor spirit but something between. They sensed his nature and gave him wide berth, recognizing a predator more dangerous than themselves.

One such creature, resembling a fox with too many tails and crystalline growths along its spine, actually bowed its head as he passed, a gesture of deference that would have been impossible for a normal animal. Wei Liang paused, studying the creature with his enhanced perception.

Its spiritual essence had been altered by the Wastes, developing a primitive consciousness beyond its original nature. Not cultivation in the traditional sense, but an adaptation to corruption that had granted it new awareness.

On impulse, Wei Liang reached out with his senses, not to consume but to communicate. The creature tensed initially, then relaxed as it recognized his intention. No words passed between them—the fox-thing lacked language as humans understood it—but impressions flowed: territory, safety, threats, resources.

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. The creature knew the Wastes in ways he did not—the safe paths, the dangerous zones, the places where reality broke down completely. Such knowledge could prove valuable.

He projected gratitude toward the fox-thing, then continued on his way, incorporating its territorial knowledge into his route. The interaction left him thoughtful. If even corrupted beasts could adapt and evolve in the Wastes, developing new forms of awareness, what possibilities might the Forgotten Path open for someone who approached it with intention rather than mere survival?

By the time Wei Liang reached the crystal valley, the twilight had deepened again, shadows stretching longer across the corrupted landscape. The crystalline pavilion stood as he had left it, its translucent walls glowing with inner light that responded to his approach.

He entered the structure, moving directly to the wall section that contained inscriptions about the Hollowborn stage. Reading them again with his expanded understanding, he found new meaning in passages that had seemed obscure before.

*The Hollowborn carries a fragment of the void within. This fragment seeks reunion with its source, creating a tether that transcends physical distance. Through this tether, influence flows both ways—the void shapes the vessel, and the vessel directs the void.*

The connection he had sensed during meditation. The inscriptions confirmed it was an expected aspect of his transformation, not an anomaly. But they also suggested something more concerning—that the influence between himself and the array was bidirectional. The void within him was changing him, yes, but his choices could also affect the wound in reality at the array's center.

Wei Liang continued reading, searching for more specific information about this connection and its implications. The inscriptions became more technical, describing energy patterns and void resonances in terms that stretched his comprehension despite his years of secret study.

One passage, however, stood out with disturbing clarity:

*As the vessel progresses along the Path, the tether strengthens. At the final threshold, vessel and void become indistinguishable. The Nameless emerges as both container and contained, capable of reshaping reality according to its nature. This is both the Path's ultimate promise and its greatest danger, for few vessels retain sufficient self to direct such power toward purpose rather than mere consumption.*

Wei Liang stepped back from the wall, absorbing the implications. The Forgotten Path didn't merely offer power as traditional cultivation did—it offered transformation into something beyond human, something capable of affecting reality itself. But at the cost of identity, of self, of purpose beyond hunger.

The Hollow Woman's warning made more sense now. Her caution about revenge being a beginning, not an end. Without a purpose beyond consumption and retribution, the Path would eventually consume the very self that sought power in the first place.

Wei Liang moved to the center of the pavilion, settling once more into meditation. This time, he deliberately explored the connection between himself and the array, not merely sensing it but testing its nature. He found that he could, with effort, send his awareness along this tether, perceiving the array site directly despite the physical distance separating them.

The array's collapse had continued in his absence. Reality fissures had multiplied, creating a maze of tears in the fabric of existence. The wound at the center pulsed with void energy, drawing in ambient spiritual essence and corrupting it. And around this wound, crystalline structures had begun to form—growths similar to those now developing within Wei Liang's transformed body.

The sight confirmed his suspicions. His transformation and the array's corruption were progressing in parallel, linked through the void fragment within him. What happened to one would affect the other.

Wei Liang withdrew his awareness, returning fully to the pavilion. The implications required careful consideration. If the connection grew stronger as he advanced along the Forgotten Path, would the array's corruption also intensify? Would his pursuit of power accelerate the Wastes' expansion? And if so, what responsibility did that place on him?

Such questions would have seemed absurd to the servant boy who had carried water for the Azure Peaks Sect, or even to the rootless disciple who had secretly studied cultivation techniques he could never perform. But to the Hollowborn he had become, they were unavoidable.

Before he could pursue these thoughts further, Wei Liang's enhanced senses detected movement at the valley's edge. Multiple presences approaching—human, cultivators, their spiritual energy bright and structured in his perception. Not a search party this time, but something more purposeful. More dangerous.

Wei Liang moved to the pavilion's entrance, extending his senses to their maximum range. Six cultivators, all at the Core Formation realm or higher. Their formation was tight and disciplined, designed for combat rather than search. And their spiritual energy carried a particular resonance he recognized from his studies—purification techniques, specifically developed to counter corruption.

Hunters. Specialists in cleansing Waste-touched entities and artifacts.

Wei Liang activated the concealment technique the Hollow Woman had taught him, creating a shell of absorbed energy around his core emptiness. But he suspected it wouldn't fool these cultivators for long—they were trained to detect precisely what he was trying to hide.

He had two options: flee deeper into the Wastes, or observe from hiding to learn more about these new threats. The hunger within him suggested a third option—attack, consume, grow stronger—but Wei Liang dismissed this as suicidal against such opponents.

Choosing observation, he moved from the pavilion to a nearby crystal formation that offered both concealment and a clear view of the approaching cultivators. From this vantage point, he could study their techniques and capabilities without exposing himself unnecessarily.

The hunters entered the valley in arrow formation, a white-robed cultivator at the point position. This leader held a jade compass that glowed with spiritual energy, its needle swinging in different directions as it detected corruption. The other five cultivators maintained a protective formation around him, their weapons drawn and glowing with purification energy.

Wei Liang recognized their robes—not Azure Peaks Sect, but the White Lotus Temple, specialists in purification cultivation who operated independently of the major sects. Their presence suggested the situation in the Wastes had escalated beyond a simple lost artifact. Something had drawn their attention specifically to this valley.

The leader paused, consulting his compass. "The corruption nexus is nearby," he announced, his voice carrying clearly in the crystalline environment. "Recent manifestation, but unusually potent. Possibly connected to the array destabilization."

One of the other cultivators, a woman with a silver sword, gestured toward the pavilion. "That structure isn't natural to the Wastes. It's too ordered, too purposeful."

The leader nodded. "A remnant from before the cataclysm, preserved in the corruption. The compass indicates it's a focal point for void energy."

They approached the pavilion cautiously, maintaining their protective formation. Wei Liang remained perfectly still, controlling even his breathing to minimize any detectable presence. The concealment technique strained under the pressure of proximity to such powerful cultivators, requiring constant adjustment to maintain.

The hunters entered the pavilion, their purification energy creating visible disturbance in the crystalline structure. Wei Liang could sense the conflict between their techniques and the ancient power embedded in the crystals—like oil and water refusing to mix.

"These inscriptions," the silver-sword woman said, examining the walls. "They describe a cultivation method. One I've never encountered in any orthodox text."

The leader approached the wall, his expression grave as he studied the ancient writing. "The Forgotten Path. One of the inverse methods from before the divine war. This shouldn't exist anymore—the Purification Conclave eradicated all records centuries ago."

"Yet here it stands," another hunter observed. "Preserved in the Wastes all this time."

The leader's face hardened. "And recently used. These energy signatures are fresh—someone has been here, reading these inscriptions, absorbing this knowledge."

Wei Liang tensed, preparing to flee if necessary. The hunters were too close to his position, their senses too acute. If they expanded their detection range even slightly, they would find him despite his concealment.

"Could it be connected to the Azure Peaks expedition?" the silver-sword woman asked. "They lost a disciple and an artifact in this region."

"Possible," the leader conceded. "Though a normal disciple couldn't interpret these inscriptions, let alone implement the techniques they describe."

"Unless they weren't normal," another hunter suggested. "The lost disciple was rootless, according to the report. No spirit root, no cultivation potential."

The leader's head snapped up, his expression changing from concern to alarm. "Rootless? You're certain?"

The hunter nodded. "That's what the Azure Peaks representative told the Conclave. A rootless disciple named Wei Liang, presumed dead after a confrontation with reality fissures."

"Heavens preserve us," the leader whispered, his face paling. "We need to report this immediately. If a rootless individual has found the Forgotten Path..."

He didn't finish the thought, but the other hunters' expressions reflected his alarm. They began a hasty examination of the pavilion, collecting energy samples and copying select inscriptions into jade slips for later study.

Wei Liang remained hidden, absorbing this unexpected information. The hunters feared the combination of rootlessness and the Forgotten Path specifically. Why? What made his particular condition so alarming to these specialists?

The inscriptions hadn't mentioned any special connection between rootlessness and the Path. The Hollow Woman hadn't indicated his lack of spirit root was significant beyond making adaptation easier. Yet these hunters, experts in their field, reacted with near panic to the possibility.

There was knowledge here he lacked, context he didn't possess. And that ignorance could prove dangerous.

The hunters completed their investigation of the pavilion and began a systematic search of the surrounding area. Their search pattern would bring them dangerously close to Wei Liang's hiding place within minutes. He needed to move, but any movement risked detection.

Drawing on the concealment technique, Wei Liang focused on projecting absolute stillness—not just physical immobility but spiritual quiescence. The emptiness within him, usually hungry and active, he temporarily compressed to its smallest possible state, reducing his detectable presence to nearly nothing.

The effort was enormous, like trying to compress water with bare hands. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite his transformed physiology, and the strain threatened to shatter his concentration. But he held, motionless and nearly undetectable, as the hunters passed within feet of his position.

The silver-sword woman paused, frowning, her senses clearly detecting something amiss. She turned slowly, gaze passing over Wei Liang's hiding place without focusing on him specifically.

"Something's here," she said quietly. "But it's... strange. Like looking at a shadow from the corner of your eye."

The leader joined her, his jade compass extended. The needle swung erratically, unable to fix on Wei Liang's compressed emptiness. "The corruption makes detection unreliable. We'll need to perform a purification sweep of the entire valley before we can be certain."

They moved away, rejoining the other hunters who had completed their search of the immediate area. Wei Liang remained frozen, maintaining his compressed state despite the mounting strain. Only when the hunters had moved to the valley's far side did he dare release the technique, his emptiness expanding back to its normal state with an almost audible snap.

The hunger surged back immediately, intensified by the effort of compression. Wei Liang fought it down, focusing on the immediate need to escape before the hunters began their purification sweep. Such techniques would likely cause him significant harm in his current state, perhaps even reverse his transformation entirely.

Moving with preternatural silence, Wei Liang slipped from his hiding place and made his way toward the valley's edge opposite from the hunters' position. His enhanced senses remained fixed on their location, tracking their movements and energy fluctuations to time his own retreat.

He had nearly reached the boundary when a sound stopped him—a crystalline chime that resonated through the valley. The hunters reacted immediately, their formation tightening as they turned toward the source.

The Hollow Woman stood atop the pavilion, her darkness stark against the crystalline structure. She made no attempt at concealment, her void nature fully visible to the hunters' specialized senses.

"The White Lotus Temple sends its dogs into my territory," she said, her echoing voice carrying clearly. "How nostalgic. It's been, what, seventy years since your last failed attempt to 'purify' me?"

The leader stepped forward, jade compass raised defensively. "The Hollow Woman. We thought you had finally faded."

"Disappointed?" Her form shifted, darkness flowing like liquid. "I endure, as does the truth your Conclave tries so desperately to erase."

The hunters spread out, clearly preparing for combat. The silver-sword woman's blade began to glow with intensified purification energy. "You've violated the Containment Accord by accessing the crystal pavilion. The corrupted knowledge within was sealed for good reason."

The Hollow Woman's laugh echoed unnaturally. "I violated nothing. The pavilion opened itself to one who could read its wisdom. I merely observed, as is my right in these Wastes."

"Where is the rootless one?" the leader demanded. "We know he survived. We know he's been here."

"Do you?" Her form expanded, darkness spreading outward like wings. "Then you know more than I. Perhaps you should continue your search... elsewhere."

With these words, she gestured sharply. The crystals throughout the valley responded, vibrating at increasing frequency until they emitted a sound that pierced through Wei Liang's enhanced senses like physical pain. The hunters clutched their heads, their formation breaking as the sound disrupted their concentration.

The Hollow Woman flowed from the pavilion's top directly toward Wei Liang's position, moving faster than seemed possible. As she reached him, her darkness enveloped him completely, and the world shifted around them.

When the darkness receded, they stood in a different part of the Wastes entirely—a region where reality seemed more stable, the corruption less obvious but more deeply ingrained. The crystal valley was nowhere in sight.

"Displacement technique," the Hollow Woman explained, her form settling back into its usual state. "Useful for avoiding unwanted attention."

Wei Liang steadied himself, the sudden transition having disoriented his senses. "You came back."

"Obviously." Her tone suggested this shouldn't have been surprising. "The White Lotus hunters are dangerous, especially to one newly walking the Path. Their purification techniques could have reverted your transformation, returned you to your rootless state."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with a chill. To lose what he had gained, to return to powerlessness after tasting its opposite—the thought was more terrifying than any threat of death.

"Thank you," he said simply.

The Hollow Woman's form shifted in what might have been a shrug. "Self-interest, nothing more. A new disciple of the Path is rare enough to be worth preserving, at least until I determine whether you're more useful or dangerous."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment without offense. In the Wastes, as in the cultivation world, power and utility determined one's treatment. At least the Hollow Woman was honest about her calculations.

"The hunters knew about me specifically," he said. "They feared the combination of rootlessness and the Forgotten Path. Why?"

The darkness of her form seemed to deepen, becoming more absolute. "Because rootless individuals who walk the Path have unique... potential. Traditional cultivators are limited by their spirit roots—their nature is fixed from birth, their path predetermined. Even when they find the Forgotten Path, this limitation remains, constraining what they can become."

She moved closer, her void presence cool against his senses. "But the rootless have no such constraint. No predetermined nature. You are empty vessels from the beginning, capable of being filled with... anything."

Wei Liang considered this. "The inscriptions mentioned the Nameless—the final stage where vessel and void become indistinguishable."

"Yes." Her voice grew softer, more distant. "For most who walk the Path, the Nameless is a metaphor—they become something other than human, but still limited by their original nature. For the rootless, however..."

She didn't finish the thought, but Wei Liang understood the implication. Without a spirit root to define his fundamental nature, his transformation had fewer boundaries, fewer limitations. The emptiness that had been his greatest weakness now offered potential beyond what normal cultivators could achieve—even those who found the Forgotten Path.

"Is that why you're helping me?" he asked. "To see what I might become?"

"Curiosity is one of the few pleasures remaining to me after centuries of existence," she admitted. "And yes, I wish to see if you can avoid the fate of the last rootless one who walked this path."

"What happened to them?"

The Hollow Woman was silent for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice held an emotion Wei Liang couldn't identify—something between regret and fear.

"He became something even the Wastes couldn't contain. Something that required the combined might of every major sect to seal away." Her form contracted slightly, darkness condensing. "The cataclysm that created these Wastes? It wasn't just the forgotten gods fighting among themselves. It was also their attempt to contain what one rootless cultivator became after reaching the Nameless stage."

Wei Liang stared at her, the implications staggering. "A single cultivator caused... this?" He gestured at the broken reality around them.

"Not caused. Necessitated." She turned away, her form flowing rather than stepping. "Come. We should put more distance between ourselves and the hunters before continuing your training. They'll track us eventually—White Lotus specialists are persistent—but we can delay that reckoning."

As they moved through the more stable region of the Wastes, Wei Liang processed what he had learned. The Forgotten Path offered him power beyond what he had imagined, but at risks equally beyond his initial understanding. The hunters' fear made more sense now—they weren't merely concerned about corruption, but about the possibility of history repeating itself.

"If the rootless have such potential on this path," he asked as they traveled, "why aren't we hunted to extinction? Why allow any of us to live at all?"

"Because you're exceedingly rare," the Hollow Woman replied. "And because most rootless individuals never discover their potential. They live and die as servants, laborers, beggars—invisible to the cultivation world except as occasional tools. The sects consider it simpler to ignore you than to systematically eliminate you."

She paused, her form turning toward him. "Though some sects do quietly dispose of rootless children born within their territories. A precaution against precisely what you're becoming."

The casual mention of such atrocity didn't surprise Wei Liang. The cultivation world's brutality toward those deemed worthless was something he had experienced firsthand. That it extended to infanticide was merely the logical conclusion of a system built on power as the sole measure of value.

"And the Azure Peaks Sect?" he asked. "They kept me despite knowing I was rootless."

"An interesting question." The Hollow Woman resumed moving. "Perhaps they're more enlightened than most. Or perhaps they had other reasons for keeping you close. Reasons worth investigating, once you've grown stronger."

They continued in silence after that, Wei Liang contemplating the implications of his new knowledge while remaining alert for signs of pursuit. The Hollow Woman led him through increasingly unfamiliar territory—regions of the Wastes where corruption manifested in subtle, almost beautiful ways. Flowers that bloomed with geometric perfection. Streams that flowed in perfect circles. Birds whose songs created visible patterns in the air.

Eventually they reached a clearing where a single massive tree stood, its trunk and branches formed from what appeared to be jade rather than wood. Its leaves were thin slices of crystal that chimed softly in the perpetual twilight breeze.

"We'll rest here," the Hollow Woman said. "The Tree of Resonance masks spiritual signatures. Even White Lotus hunters will struggle to detect us in its vicinity."

Wei Liang approached the tree with cautious fascination. His enhanced senses perceived complex energy patterns flowing through its jade-like structure—not corruption exactly, but a different form of power altogether.

"What is it?" he asked.

"A remnant, like the pavilion. A living artifact from before the cataclysm." She settled at the tree's base, her darkness seeming to blend with the shadows cast by its crystalline canopy. "It grows at the boundary between corrupted and uncorrupted reality, drawing sustenance from both."

Wei Liang sat across from her, his back against the jade trunk. The contact sent a pleasant vibration through his transformed body, a resonance that seemed to stabilize the emptiness within him, making the hunger temporarily less insistent.

"You've learned much today," the Hollow Woman observed. "Perhaps too much, too quickly. The Path is not meant to be rushed."

"I don't have the luxury of time," Wei Liang replied. "The hunters know about me now. They'll report to their Conclave, which will inform the major sects. The Azure Peaks will realize I survived, that I've changed. They'll send more than search parties next time."

"True." Her form shifted, darkness flowing into a more defined shape—almost human in outline, though still featureless. "But power sought in haste is often power misused. The Forgotten Path punishes impatience more severely than most cultivation methods."

Wei Liang acknowledged the warning with a nod. "Then teach me patience along with power. Show me how to progress without losing myself to the hunger."

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely, an unusual state for her constantly shifting darkness. "An interesting request. Most who find the Path care only for advancement, for consumption, for power. Few consider the preservation of self a priority."

"I didn't survive this long by valuing power over survival," Wei Liang said. "And what use is vengeance if I'm not myself to witness it?"

A sound emerged from her darkness—something between a laugh and a sigh. "Perhaps you are different from those who came before. Very well. I will teach you what I know of balancing progression with preservation. But understand this: the Path will always demand sacrifice. The only choice is what you sacrifice, not whether you sacrifice."

Wei Liang accepted this with the pragmatism that had defined his existence. Nothing in life came without cost—this had been true when he was a servant, true when he was a rootless disciple, and remained true now that he walked the Forgotten Path. The difference was that now, for the first time, he could choose which prices he was willing to pay.

As the crystalline leaves chimed softly overhead, the Hollow Woman began her instruction—not in techniques of power, but in methods of retention. Ways to preserve memory despite the Path's erosion. Means of anchoring identity against the pull of the void. Approaches to feeding the hunger without being consumed by it.

Wei Liang absorbed these lessons with the same dedicated focus he had once applied to studying cultivation manuals he could never implement. But now, as the Hollowborn, each lesson could be immediately tested, immediately applied. His transformed nature responded to these teachings, the emptiness within him becoming more defined, more controlled, more purposeful.

In the distance, beyond perception but drawing inevitably closer, the White Lotus hunters continued their search. The Azure Peaks Sect continued its calculations. The cultivation world continued its rigid adherence to hierarchy and power.

And in the shadow of the jade tree, Wei Liang—once rootless, now Hollowborn—continued his transformation into something the cultivation world had not seen in centuries. Something they had good reason to fear.

Something that remembered.



# Chapter 6: First Hunt

The White Lotus hunters had not given up.

Wei Liang sensed them before he saw them—six points of purifying light moving through the corrupted landscape of the Wastes like surgical knives through infected flesh. Their spiritual energy carried that distinctive resonance of purification techniques, designed to excise corruption rather than merely resist it.

Seven days had passed since his encounter with them at the crystal pavilion. Seven days of intensive training under the Hollow Woman's guidance. Seven days of growing stronger, more controlled, more deliberate in his use of the Forgotten Path's techniques.

He watched the hunters from the high ridge overlooking what the Hollow Woman called the Quiet Wastes. From this distance, they couldn't detect him, especially with the concealment technique he had now mastered. His emptiness remained hidden behind a shell of absorbed energy, presenting the spiritual signature of ordinary rock and soil rather than the void that would draw their attention.

"They're persistent," he observed as the Hollow Woman flowed up beside him, her darkness stark against the perpetual twilight.

"The White Lotus Temple trains its hunters to pursue corruption with religious fervor," she replied. "They believe the Wastes are a spiritual infection that must be contained and eventually cleansed. Your existence represents a particular threat to their worldview."

Wei Liang studied the hunters' formation. They moved differently now—more cautiously, more systematically. They had adapted their approach after their failure at the crystal pavilion.

"They're tracking us," he said. "Not just searching randomly."

"Yes." The Hollow Woman's form shifted, darkness rippling with what might have been concern. "They've likely obtained something connected to you—perhaps from the Azure Peaks Sect, or from the array site. With such a focus, their tracking techniques can pierce even the Wastes' distortions."

Wei Liang considered this. "How long before they find us?"

"Days, perhaps. Hours if we're careless." Her form contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "Which makes this an opportune moment for your next lesson."

Wei Liang turned toward her, curiosity overriding his concern about the hunters. Each lesson she had taught him had expanded his understanding of the Forgotten Path and his own transformed nature. Each had made him stronger, more capable, more comfortable in his new existence.

"What lesson?" he asked.

"Consumption," she said simply. "Direct absorption of cultivated spiritual energy."

The hunger within Wei Liang responded immediately to these words, the emptiness at his core pulsing with anticipation. Until now, he had fed it only ambient energy from the Wastes—corrupted essence that satisfied the immediate need but provided little substantial growth. The thought of consuming pure, cultivated energy directly from its source sent a shiver of both desire and apprehension through him.

"From them?" He gestured toward the distant hunters.

"No." The Hollow Woman's tone carried a sharp edge. "The White Lotus hunters are beyond your current capabilities. Their purification techniques would likely destroy you if you attempted direct consumption."

She flowed away from the ridge's edge, indicating for him to follow. "There are others in the Wastes—less dangerous prey for your first hunt."

Wei Liang followed her down the ridge's far side, away from the hunters' path. As they descended, she continued her instruction.

"The Hollowborn can consume spiritual energy in three ways," she explained. "Ambient absorption, which you've already practiced. Direct consumption from willing or unconscious sources. And forcible extraction from resistant cultivators."

They reached the base of the ridge, entering a region where the corruption manifested as subtle distortions of natural growth—trees that curved at impossible angles, grass that grew in perfect geometric patterns.

"Each method has its advantages and limitations," the Hollow Woman continued. "Ambient absorption is safest but provides minimal growth. Willing donation is efficient but rare—few cultivators would voluntarily feed the Forgotten Path. Forcible extraction provides the most substantial power but carries the greatest risk, both physical and spiritual."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with his usual focused attention. "Risk beyond the obvious?"

"Yes." Her darkness seemed to deepen. "When you forcibly consume another's cultivated energy, you don't just take their power—you take fragments of their nature, their memories, their essence. These fragments can influence your own development if you're not careful to process them properly."

This explained something Wei Liang had wondered about—why those who walked the Forgotten Path were said to lose themselves as they progressed. It wasn't just the void's influence eroding identity, but the accumulated fragments of consumed cultivators altering the consumer's nature.

"How do I process these fragments properly?" he asked.

"By maintaining clear intention," she replied. "By knowing what you wish to preserve of yourself and what you're willing to discard. By consuming with purpose rather than mere hunger."

They continued through the geometrically corrupted landscape until they reached a small valley where a stream flowed in a perfect spiral pattern. Near its center stood a simple shelter constructed from materials that didn't belong in the Wastes—ordinary wood and stone rather than the crystalline or corrupted substances that dominated the region.

"Scavengers," the Hollow Woman explained, gesturing toward the shelter. "Cultivators who enter the Wastes to collect corrupted materials for sale to alchemists and artifact crafters. They operate in the boundary regions where corruption is mild enough to permit extended stays without protection."

Wei Liang extended his senses toward the shelter. Three cultivators inside—all at the Foundation Establishment realm, their spiritual energy modest but well-structured. Not sect disciples but independent practitioners, judging by the unaligned nature of their cultivation.

"Why haven't the White Lotus hunters found them?" he asked.

"The hunters focus on corruption threats, not minor scavenging operations," she replied. "These cultivators are careful to avoid deeper corruption and take only what can be safely transported out of the Wastes. They represent no threat to the containment of the Wastes' influence."

Wei Liang studied the scavengers' spiritual signatures more carefully. Their energy patterns were stable but showed signs of prolonged exposure to mild corruption—small distortions that wouldn't be noticeable outside the Wastes but were clear to his enhanced perception.

"They're already partially corrupted," he observed.

"Yes. It makes them suitable prey for your first consumption." The Hollow Woman's form settled into stillness. "Their energy will be easier to process than that of pure cultivators, and the cultivation world will not miss them should you... miscalculate."

The cold pragmatism of her assessment didn't disturb Wei Liang. His years at the Azure Peaks Sect had taught him that the cultivation world assigned value to individuals based solely on their power and connections. These independent scavengers, operating in the margins of society, would indeed go unmissed if they disappeared.

"How should I approach them?" he asked, already analyzing potential strategies.

"Directly," she said, surprising him. "Present yourself as a lost disciple. Their greed will do the rest."

Wei Liang considered this approach. It had merit—scavengers would see a lone disciple as an opportunity rather than a threat. They might attempt to rob him, or perhaps offer false assistance while leading him into a trap. Either way, it would bring them close enough for him to act.

"And when they're close enough?" he asked.

"You'll know," she replied, her voice carrying a hint of something like anticipation. "The hunger will guide you. Just remember—maintain your intention throughout. Consume with purpose, not merely appetite."

With these final instructions, the Hollow Woman flowed backward, her darkness merging with the shadows at the valley's edge. "I will observe, but not intervene unless absolutely necessary. This hunt is yours to complete or fail."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting both the responsibility and the implicit test. He adjusted his concealment technique, modifying the shell of energy around his core emptiness to present not as natural elements but as a cultivator in distress—spiritual energy fluctuating in patterns that suggested injury and exhaustion.

He tore his outer robe strategically, adding physical evidence to support his deception. A smear of soil across his face, a slight limp to his gait, and his disguise was complete—a sect disciple separated from his companions, lost and vulnerable in the Wastes.

Wei Liang approached the scavengers' shelter from the most visible direction, making no attempt to hide his presence. He allowed his footsteps to be heard, his labored breathing to carry on the still air. The performance wasn't entirely feigned—maintaining the specific energy shell required concentration, especially while in motion.

The shelter's door opened before he reached it. A man emerged—middle-aged, weather-worn, with the calloused hands and wary eyes of someone who lived by his wits in dangerous territory. His cultivation aura identified him as the strongest of the three inside, though still only at mid-Foundation Establishment.

"Ho there," the man called, one hand resting casually on the sword at his hip. "You're a long way from anywhere safe, young cultivator."

Wei Liang stopped a respectful distance away, swaying slightly as if struggling to remain upright. "Thank the heavens," he gasped. "I thought I might die out here. My sect brothers and I were separated during a reality fissure event. I've been wandering for days."

The man's eyes narrowed slightly, assessing Wei Liang with the practiced gaze of someone accustomed to evaluating both threats and opportunities. "Which sect?" he asked.

"Azure Peaks," Wei Liang replied, choosing the truth as the most convincing lie. He gestured at his torn robe, where the sect's cloud pattern remained visible despite the damage.

The man relaxed slightly, apparently finding the story plausible. "Feng Hu," he introduced himself with a shallow bow. "These are my Wastes-walking companions, Mei and Tao." He gestured toward the shelter, where a woman and another man now stood watching from the doorway.

"Wei Liang," he replied, using his real name without concern. If he succeeded in what he planned, there would be no one to report his survival anyway.

"Come inside," Feng Hu offered, stepping aside. "We have water and some food. You can rest before continuing your search."

Wei Liang bowed gratefully and limped toward the shelter. As he passed Feng Hu, he sensed the man's spiritual energy more clearly—decades of careful cultivation, structured and disciplined despite his rough appearance. A substantial meal for the emptiness within him.

The shelter's interior was simple but well-organized. Maps of the Wastes' boundary regions covered one wall, marked with locations of valuable materials and dangerous corruption zones. Storage containers lined another wall, presumably holding their scavenged items. A small cooking area occupied the center, where a pot of something aromatic simmered over a spirit-stone heating array.

"Sit," the woman, Mei, instructed, gesturing toward a simple bench. Her cultivation was the weakest of the three, but her spiritual energy had an unusual quality—flexible and adaptive rather than rigidly structured. "You look half-dead."

Wei Liang accepted the seat with murmured thanks. The third scavenger, Tao, handed him a cup of water, which he sipped slowly, maintaining his facade of exhaustion while observing the three with his enhanced senses.

They were cautious but not immediately hostile. Their spiritual energy remained in a neutral state—neither gathered for attack nor completely relaxed. Experienced survivors, then, neither trusting nor overtly suspicious.

"What brought Azure Peaks disciples so deep into the Wastes?" Feng Hu asked, seating himself across from Wei Liang. "You're a bit beyond your sect's usual territory."

"A recovery mission," Wei Liang replied, mixing truth and falsehood. "An artifact was detected in the inner regions. Our team was sent to retrieve it."

The three scavengers exchanged glances that confirmed Wei Liang's assessment of their nature. The mention of an artifact had sparked immediate interest—and calculation.

"Valuable artifact?" Tao asked, trying to sound casual and failing.

Wei Liang allowed a hint of sect disciple arrogance to color his response. "Valuable enough for Elder Shen to send a full team of inner disciples." He paused, then added with apparent reluctance, "And now it's lost, along with my sect brothers. Elder Shen will have my cultivation crippled for this failure."

Another exchange of glances between the scavengers. Wei Liang could practically see their thoughts—a desperate disciple, a valuable artifact, and the possibility of profit from both.

"Perhaps we could help you find your sect brothers," Feng Hu suggested, his tone carefully neutral despite the greed Wei Liang could sense in his spiritual fluctuations. "We know these regions better than most. For a reasonable finder's fee, of course."

"I have nothing to offer," Wei Liang said, injecting desperation into his voice. "Everything I carried was lost when we were separated."

Mei leaned forward, her expression sympathetic but her eyes calculating. "Your sect would surely reward those who helped return one of their disciples safely, wouldn't they? Especially if we could help locate this artifact as well."

Wei Liang pretended to consider this, as if weighing his limited options. "I... suppose they would. Elder Shen is strict but fair. If you could help me find either my sect brothers or the artifact, I'm certain she would compensate you appropriately."

Feng Hu nodded, apparently satisfied with this arrangement. "Rest tonight. Tomorrow we'll begin searching. The Wastes are dangerous to traverse without proper knowledge."

"Thank you," Wei Liang said, bowing his head in apparent gratitude. "I won't forget this kindness."

The scavengers relaxed further, their greed overriding whatever caution they might normally exercise. They began discussing search patterns and territory divisions, already planning how to maximize their chances of finding either the fictional sect brothers or the valuable artifact.

Wei Liang maintained his disguise throughout the evening, accepting a bowl of the simmering stew and listening to the scavengers' stories of their finds in the Wastes. He learned useful information about the boundary regions and the patterns of corruption, filing it away for future reference.

As night fell—or what passed for night in the perpetual twilight of the Wastes—the scavengers prepared for sleep. They arranged simple bedrolls around the shelter's perimeter, positioning Wei Liang nearest the door in a show of hospitality that was likely meant to prevent him from accessing their stored scavenged materials.

"Rest well," Feng Hu said as he settled onto his own bedroll. "Tomorrow will require strength and focus."

Wei Liang nodded, lying down and feigning immediate exhaustion. He regulated his breathing to mimic sleep while maintaining complete awareness through his enhanced senses. The scavengers remained awake for some time, conversing in whispers they thought too quiet for him to hear.

"...could ransom him back to the sect," Tao suggested.

"Fool," Mei hissed. "Azure Peaks doesn't negotiate with scavengers. They'd send cultivators to retrieve him and punish us."

"The artifact is the real prize," Feng Hu decided. "We help him search, but we find it first. Then we can decide whether to return him or not."

Wei Liang listened to their plotting with cold amusement. Their petty schemes seemed almost childish compared to the fate he had planned for them. They saw him as a resource to be exploited; he saw them as sustenance to be consumed.

He waited patiently until their whispers ceased and their breathing deepened into genuine sleep. Their spiritual energy settled into the distinctive patterns of unconsciousness—still present but less structured, more vulnerable.

Wei Liang rose silently, his transformed body moving without sound across the shelter's floor. He positioned himself at the center of the triangle formed by the three sleeping scavengers, equidistant from each. Then he released the concealment technique, allowing his true nature to emerge.

The emptiness within him expanded, no longer constrained by the shell of false energy. The hunger, held in check for hours, surged forward with almost painful intensity. Wei Liang controlled it with effort, remembering the Hollow Woman's warning—consume with purpose, not merely appetite.

He focused on his intention: to absorb these cultivators' energy without taking on their nature, to grow stronger without being influenced by their essence. With this purpose firmly in mind, he extended his awareness toward the closest scavenger—Mei.

Her spiritual energy responded to his attention, fluctuating slightly even in sleep. Wei Liang reached out not with physical touch but with the emptiness itself, extending tendrils of void toward her cultivation core. The contact was delicate, almost gentle—not forcible extraction yet, but preparation for it.

Mei stirred, her subconscious sensing the intrusion despite her unconscious state. Wei Liang paused, waiting for her to settle again before continuing. When her breathing returned to its deep rhythm, he resumed his approach, void tendrils penetrating deeper toward her spiritual center.

The hunger urged him to rush, to devour her energy in one violent consumption. Wei Liang resisted, maintaining the slow, methodical approach the Hollow Woman had described during his training. Rushing would not only wake the scavengers but would make processing their energy more difficult.

When the void tendrils finally reached Mei's cultivation core, Wei Liang felt a moment of connection—a bridge between his emptiness and her energy. Through this connection, he sensed fragments of her essence: ambition tempered by pragmatism, greed balanced by survival instinct, loyalty to her companions born of necessity rather than affection.

With careful precision, Wei Liang began to draw her spiritual energy across the connection. Not in a rush, but in a steady flow—like drinking from a cup rather than upending it. The energy entered his emptiness, cool and substantial, more satisfying than the ambient corruption he had absorbed previously.

Mei's body tensed, her face contorting in discomfort though she remained asleep. Her spiritual energy resisted instinctively, trying to maintain its integrity against the drain. Wei Liang increased the pull slightly, overcoming this unconscious resistance without waking her.

As her energy flowed into him, Wei Liang processed it according to the Hollow Woman's instructions—separating pure power from the fragments of personality and memory that accompanied it. The power he directed into his core emptiness, allowing it to strengthen his transformed being. The fragments he examined briefly before discarding most, retaining only practical knowledge about the Wastes and cultivation techniques he found useful.

Mei's breathing grew labored as the drain continued. Her spiritual energy diminished steadily, her cultivation base eroding under Wei Liang's careful consumption. He monitored her condition closely, aware that taking too much would kill her rather than merely weaken her. Death would complicate his plan for the other two.

When he had consumed approximately half her spiritual energy—enough to significantly strengthen himself without immediately endangering her life—Wei Liang withdrew the void tendrils. The connection severed, leaving Mei pale and sweating but alive. Her cultivation had been reduced from early Foundation Establishment to something barely above mortal levels.

Without pausing to savor this first successful consumption, Wei Liang turned his attention to Tao. The process was repeated—the careful approach, the connection, the steady drain of energy. Tao's essence carried different fragments: resentment toward the major sects, pride in his independence, fear of the deeper Wastes. Wei Liang processed these as he had Mei's, discarding most while absorbing the pure energy into his emptiness.

By the time he finished with Tao, Wei Liang could feel the changes in his transformed body. The emptiness within him felt more substantial somehow, more defined. The crystalline structures that had begun forming throughout his flesh grew more pronounced, more complex. His senses sharpened further, allowing him to perceive spiritual energy with greater precision.

He turned finally to Feng Hu, the strongest of the three and therefore the most valuable source. As Wei Liang extended his void tendrils toward the man's cultivation core, he felt resistance even before making contact—Feng Hu's spiritual energy was better protected, more disciplined even in sleep.

Wei Liang adjusted his approach, making the tendrils thinner, more subtle, less detectable to spiritual senses. It took longer to establish the connection, requiring more precision and control, but eventually he succeeded. Feng Hu's essence revealed decades of hard-won cultivation, bitter experiences that had shaped both his techniques and his character, knowledge of the Wastes that exceeded his companions'.

The consumption process began as before, with Wei Liang drawing Feng Hu's spiritual energy in a steady, controlled flow. The man's cultivation resisted more strongly than the others', his spiritual foundations more firmly established through years of practice. Wei Liang increased the pull gradually, overcoming this resistance without triggering defensive reflexes that might wake him.

As Feng Hu's energy flowed into him, Wei Liang felt the hunger growing more insistent, demanding complete consumption rather than partial feeding. The emptiness within him, partially filled by Mei and Tao's energy, now wanted to devour Feng Hu entirely—to take not just his power but his very essence.

Wei Liang struggled to maintain his original intention. Consume with purpose, not appetite. Take what strengthens without changing your nature. He repeated these principles mentally while continuing the careful drain of Feng Hu's cultivation.

The scavenger's breathing grew increasingly labored, his face contorting in pain despite remaining unconscious. His spiritual energy fought harder against the drain as it diminished, instinctive survival mechanisms activating even without conscious direction.

Wei Liang had consumed perhaps two-thirds of Feng Hu's cultivation when the man's eyes snapped open, awareness returning despite the spiritual drain. For a moment, confusion dominated his expression—then horror as he perceived Wei Liang's true nature through spiritual senses.

"Waste-fiend!" Feng Hu gasped, his hand moving toward the sword beside his bedroll. "Corruption incarnate!"

Wei Liang didn't bother correcting this misidentification. Instead, he intensified the connection, shifting from careful consumption to forcible extraction. The void tendrils thickened, pulling Feng Hu's remaining spiritual energy in a torrent rather than a stream.

The scavenger tried to resist, attempting to gather his diminished power for a defensive technique. But with most of his cultivation already consumed, his efforts were futile. His spiritual energy continued flowing into Wei Liang's emptiness, now accompanied by fragments of conscious thought and immediate emotion—fear, rage, disbelief.

These conscious fragments were harder to process, carrying stronger imprints of Feng Hu's identity. Wei Liang struggled to separate power from essence, to consume one without absorbing the other. Some fragments slipped through his filtering, briefly imposing foreign thoughts and emotions on his consciousness before he could isolate and discard them.

Feng Hu's hand closed around his sword hilt, but he lacked the strength to draw the weapon. His cultivation nearly depleted, his physical body began to fail as well—systems dependent on spiritual energy shutting down one by one.

"What... are you?" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Wei Liang met his gaze directly, allowing the scavenger to see what he had become. "The consequence of abandonment," he replied, his voice carrying the faint echo that had developed since his transformation. "The price of betrayal."

Feng Hu's eyes widened in final understanding before the last of his spiritual energy flowed into Wei Liang's emptiness. Without cultivation to sustain his aging body, the scavenger collapsed, dead before he hit the ground.

The sudden death sent a pulse of energy through the shelter—not spiritual but something more primal, the release that accompanies a soul's departure from its vessel. This pulse disturbed the remaining scavengers' sleep, drawing them toward consciousness despite their weakened state.

Wei Liang turned toward Mei as her eyes fluttered open. Her spiritual senses, diminished but not entirely gone, registered his true nature immediately. Unlike Feng Hu, however, her reaction wasn't horror but despair—the recognition that escape was impossible.

"Please," she whispered, too weak to move from her bedroll. "Mercy."

Wei Liang considered her request dispassionately. The hunger within him was partially sated by the three consumptions, no longer demanding immediate feeding. He could spare her life without compromising his growth. The question was whether doing so served his purpose.

"What would you do with mercy if granted it?" he asked, curious despite himself.

Mei swallowed, her gaze darting to Feng Hu's lifeless form before returning to Wei Liang. "Live," she said simply. "Continue. Survive."

An honest answer, at least. No promises of redemption or change, just the basic drive to exist that had likely guided her entire life. Wei Liang respected the simplicity of it, the absence of pretense.

"Then survive," he decided, stepping away from her. "Return to the cultivation world. Tell them what you encountered in the Wastes. Describe what I've become."

Relief flooded her face, quickly followed by confusion. "You want me to warn them about you?"

"I want them to know I'm coming," Wei Liang clarified. "I want them to prepare, to gather their strength, to believe they can stop what approaches. It will make their failure more complete when it comes."

Understanding dawned in Mei's eyes, followed by a fear deeper than her earlier despair. Not fear for herself, but for the cultivation world that remained ignorant of what had awakened in the Wastes.

"Who should I tell?" she asked, her voice steadier now that immediate death no longer threatened.

"The Azure Peaks Sect," Wei Liang replied. "Tell them Wei Liang has found a new path. Tell them he remembers their betrayal. Tell them he's coming home."

Tao stirred on his bedroll, consciousness returning more slowly due to his weaker constitution. Wei Liang glanced at him briefly before returning his attention to Mei.

"Take him with you," he instructed. "Two witnesses are more convincing than one. Leave now, before I reconsider my mercy."

Mei didn't need to be told twice. Despite her weakened state, she rose shakily and moved to Tao, helping him to his feet. They gathered nothing from the shelter, abandoning their scavenged materials and supplies in their haste to escape.

At the door, Mei paused, looking back at Wei Liang with an expression he couldn't quite interpret. "What are you becoming?" she asked, the question seeming driven by genuine curiosity rather than fear.

Wei Liang considered his answer carefully. "Something forgotten," he finally said. "Something the cultivation world tried to erase from memory. Something returning to remind them of what they abandoned."

Mei nodded slowly, as if his cryptic answer confirmed some private thought. Without another word, she and Tao departed, supporting each other as they stumbled away from the shelter and the horror it contained.

Wei Liang watched them go, tracking their spiritual signatures until they passed beyond even his enhanced perception. Only then did he turn his attention inward, examining the changes wrought by his first true feeding.

The emptiness within him had evolved, developing structure within its void. The hunger remained but felt different—more focused, more patient, more purposeful. His physical form had changed as well, the crystalline alterations spreading further throughout his flesh, replacing more of his original humanity with something other.

He extended his awareness outward, testing the limits of his enhanced perception. His range had increased significantly, allowing him to sense spiritual energy at greater distances and with finer discrimination. He could detect the White Lotus hunters from his current position, still following their methodical search pattern several miles away.

"An efficient first hunt," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing through the shelter's door without opening it. "Though perhaps more merciful than I expected."

Wei Liang turned toward her, unsurprised by her sudden appearance. He had sensed her watching throughout the consumption process, her void presence distinct even when she attempted to conceal it.

"Mercy serves my purpose," he replied. "Their warnings will create anticipation, expectation. The cultivation world will prepare for a threat they think they understand."

"And they will face one beyond their comprehension," she concluded, her form shifting as she examined him. "You've changed more than I anticipated from a single feeding. The rootless truly do progress differently along this path."

Wei Liang moved to the shelter's center, where Feng Hu's body lay. The scavenger's face remained frozen in that final moment of understanding, eyes wide, mouth slightly open. Wei Liang closed those staring eyes with a gesture that might have been respect in another life.

"What stage have I reached?" he asked, sensing that his transformation had advanced beyond the basic Hollowborn state.

"You approach the threshold of Fracture," the Hollow Woman replied. "The second stage of the Forgotten Path. Your emptiness has begun to develop structure—the first sign of progression beyond mere consumption."

Wei Liang recalled the inscriptions describing this stage. Fracture involved the splintering of identity, the fragmentation of self to create space for greater power. It granted abilities beyond simple energy absorption—limited reality manipulation, spiritual interference, enhanced corruption resistance.

"How long before I cross that threshold?" he asked.

"That depends on you," she said. "On how quickly you consume, how effectively you process what you take, how purposefully you direct your transformation." Her form contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "But I would estimate days rather than weeks, given your rate of progression."

Wei Liang absorbed this assessment without visible reaction, though internally he felt a complex mixture of satisfaction and wariness. Rapid advancement meant growing power but also accelerated cost—the erosion of self that accompanied progression along the Forgotten Path.

"The White Lotus hunters will find this place soon," he observed, changing the subject. "They'll know what happened here."

"Yes," the Hollow Woman agreed. "Which means we should depart before they arrive. Their tracking abilities will be enhanced once they confirm your nature through direct evidence."

Wei Liang nodded, seeing the wisdom in this suggestion. He had no desire to confront the hunters yet, not until he had crossed the threshold into Fracture and gained a better understanding of his evolving abilities.

"Where should we go?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's form flowed toward the door. "Deeper into the Wastes. To places where even the White Lotus fears to tread. Where corruption has transformed reality so completely that their purification techniques become useless."

Wei Liang followed her outside, leaving the shelter and its single dead occupant behind. The perpetual twilight of the Wastes seemed different to his enhanced perception—richer in detail, more varied in its subtle gradations of light and shadow. The corruption that permeated everything appeared not as wrongness but as potential, as possibility unrestricted by conventional laws.

They traveled in silence for a time, moving away from the boundary regions into territories where corruption grew more pronounced. Reality fissures appeared with increasing frequency—tears in existence that connected distant locations or different aspects of the Wastes. The landscape itself became less recognizable as natural terrain, transforming into formations that defied conventional geometry.

As they walked, Wei Liang processed the energy he had consumed, integrating it more fully into his transformed being. The fragments of the scavengers' essences he had inadvertently absorbed were examined, understood, and either discarded or carefully stored away from his core identity. Their knowledge he retained—survival techniques, Wastes navigation, cultivation methods that might prove useful despite their orthodox nature.

"You maintain your sense of self well," the Hollow Woman observed after several hours of travel. "Most who walk this path struggle more with the fragments they absorb."

"I had practice before the Path," Wei Liang replied. "Years of separating what others believed me to be from what I knew myself to be. Years of preserving an inner self while presenting an outer face that satisfied expectations."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been acknowledgment. "A survival strategy that now serves a different purpose. Interesting how our pasts prepare us for futures we cannot anticipate."

They continued deeper into the Wastes, passing through regions where corruption had created beauty as often as horror—crystalline forests that sang in harmonic resonance, lakes where liquid flowed upward in perpetual fountains, fields of flowers that bloomed with mathematical precision in fractal patterns.

Eventually they reached a boundary unlike any Wei Liang had encountered before—not a physical barrier but a threshold in reality itself, visible to his enhanced perception as a shimmering curtain of energy that stretched across their path.

"The Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman announced, her form expanding slightly as they approached this boundary. "The heart of corruption, where the cataclysm's effects are most concentrated. Few enter willingly. Fewer still return unchanged, if they return at all."

Wei Liang studied the threshold with all his senses. Beyond it, corruption wasn't just present but dominant—reality itself rewoven according to principles that contradicted normal existence. The ambient energy there was denser, more potent, more fundamentally altered from its original state.

"What will we find beyond?" he asked.

"Challenges suitable for your continued growth," she replied. "Entities neither human nor spirit, but transformed by prolonged exposure to corruption. Artifacts from before the cataclysm, preserved in distorted states. Knowledge forbidden by the cultivation world for good reason."

She turned toward him, her darkness condensing until he could almost make out features within it—eyes that evaluated, a mouth that spoke with centuries of experience.

"And privacy," she added. "The White Lotus hunters will not follow us there. Their purification techniques would be not merely ineffective but actively dangerous to them in the Deep Wastes. The corruption there can invert their methods, turning purification into accelerated corruption."

Wei Liang considered the threshold and what lay beyond it. The hunger within him responded to the potent energy he sensed, eager to consume and grow stronger. But caution tempered this eagerness—the Deep Wastes clearly presented dangers as well as opportunities.

"You've been there before," he said, not a question but an observation.

"Many times," she confirmed. "It is where I retreated after turning back from the final threshold. Where I've existed for centuries, neither advancing nor retreating along the Path."

Wei Liang sensed there was more to her story—reasons for her retreat, purposes for her continued existence—but he didn't press. The Hollow Woman revealed what she chose to reveal, when she chose to reveal it. Demanding more would likely yield nothing.

"Will crossing this boundary accelerate my transformation?" he asked instead.

"Yes," she said simply. "The Deep Wastes intensify all processes, including progression along the Forgotten Path. Your advancement toward Fracture will proceed more rapidly there, perhaps more rapidly than is wise."

"Yet you suggest we go there anyway."

"Because the alternatives are worse," she replied. "Remaining in the outer Wastes means eventual confrontation with the White Lotus hunters before you're ready. Returning to the cultivation world means facing sects with resources to contain or destroy you. The Deep Wastes offer time and opportunity to grow stronger before such confrontations become necessary."

Wei Liang couldn't argue with her logic. His purpose required strength beyond what he currently possessed—strength to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, strength to reshape a system that had deemed him worthless from birth. If the Deep Wastes offered the fastest path to such strength, then the risks were acceptable.

"How do we cross?" he asked, studying the threshold's shimmering energy.

"With intention," the Hollow Woman replied. "The boundary responds to purpose. Enter with clear understanding of why you seek the Deep Wastes, and it will permit passage. Enter with confusion or fear, and it will reject you—violently."

Wei Liang focused his thoughts, clarifying his purpose. He sought the Deep Wastes for growth, for knowledge, for preparation. He sought power not as an end but as a means—a tool to force recognition from a world that had refused to see him. He sought transformation not to escape his identity but to fulfill it—to become the consequence of others' actions, the embodiment of their failure to value what they had discarded.

With this purpose firmly in mind, he stepped forward, approaching the shimmering boundary. The energy responded to his proximity, rippling like water disturbed by a stone. As he reached the threshold itself, he felt resistance—not rejection but evaluation, as if the boundary itself possessed some form of consciousness that judged those who sought passage.

For a moment, Wei Liang stood suspended between realms, his transformed body half in the outer Wastes, half in the threshold itself. The boundary energy flowed around and through him, examining his nature, his purpose, his potential. He felt it probe the emptiness within him, the hunger that drove him, the remnants of humanity that still defined his core identity.

Then, with a sensation like passing through a waterfall, he was through—standing fully in the Deep Wastes, surrounded by a reality so fundamentally altered that it defied complete comprehension even with his enhanced senses.

The Hollow Woman followed, her darkness flowing through the boundary with practiced ease. She reformed beside him, her void nature seeming more at home in this corrupted environment than in the relatively normal outer Wastes.

"Welcome," she said, "to the place the cultivation world fears above all others. The source of corruption. The heart of the cataclysm. The Deep Wastes, where reality obeys different laws and power takes forms unknown to orthodox cultivation."

Wei Liang absorbed his surroundings with all senses extended. The landscape defied conventional description—structures that might be mountains or might be frozen waves of solid energy; vegetation that grew in four dimensions, extending into spaces that shouldn't exist; a sky that displayed not stars or sun or moon but mathematical patterns that shifted according to principles he couldn't yet grasp.

The ambient energy here was thick enough to be almost visible, flowing in currents and eddies that connected everything in complex networks. Corruption wasn't a foreign element here but the fundamental nature of existence—not a distortion of reality but reality itself, operating according to its own consistent but alien logic.

"I can feel it already," Wei Liang said, sensing changes accelerating within his transformed body. The crystalline structures spread more rapidly, replacing more of his original flesh with their alien substance. The emptiness within him expanded and contracted in new rhythms, processing the dense ambient energy without conscious direction.

"Yes," the Hollow Woman acknowledged. "The Deep Wastes will accelerate your transformation. You must be vigilant to maintain control of the process rather than being controlled by it."

She led him deeper into this impossible landscape, moving along paths that seemed to form themselves in response to their passage. As they traveled, Wei Liang observed entities in the distance—shapes that suggested consciousness without conforming to any recognizable species or category. Some noticed their passage, turning sensory organs or structures that served similar purposes toward them before returning to incomprehensible activities.

"The inhabitants," the Hollow Woman explained, noticing his attention. "Some were human once, or spirit beasts, or other recognizable beings. Others formed spontaneously from the corruption itself, consciousness emerging from complexity without conventional birth or creation."

"Are they dangerous?" Wei Liang asked, tracking one particularly large entity that resembled a geometric storm more than any living creature.

"All things in the Deep Wastes are dangerous in their own ways," she replied. "But most will ignore us if we don't interfere with their territories or purposes. They recognize me, and by extension, you as under my protection. For now."

They continued until they reached a formation that resembled a mountain if mountains could fold in on themselves, creating spaces that were simultaneously interior and exterior. Within one such impossible fold, a structure stood—not a building in conventional terms, but a space defined by boundaries that suggested habitation.

"My dwelling in the Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman said, her form flowing toward the entrance. "More secure than the inverted cottage, more isolated than the jade tree. Here we can continue your training without concern for hunters or other interruptions."

Wei Liang followed her inside, finding a space that somehow felt both alien and familiar. The interior defied normal geometry, with angles that shouldn't connect forming continuous surfaces, but the basic elements of habitation remained recognizable—areas for rest, for study, for practice.

Most striking was a wall covered entirely in script similar to that from the crystal pavilion—the ancient writing that described the Forgotten Path and its stages. Here, however, the inscriptions were more extensive, more detailed, covering aspects of the Path that the pavilion had only hinted at.

"My own records," the Hollow Woman explained, noticing his interest. "Compiled over centuries of walking the Path and observing others who attempted it. More complete than the pavilion's knowledge, more accurate in some respects."

Wei Liang approached the wall, his enhanced perception allowing him to absorb the dense information more efficiently than would have been possible before his transformation. The inscriptions described techniques, progressions, warnings, and possibilities he hadn't encountered in the pavilion's more limited text.

"Study these," the Hollow Woman instructed. "Understand what awaits as you progress toward Fracture and beyond. Knowledge is your best defense against the Path's tendency to consume identity along with power."

Wei Liang nodded, already immersing himself in the ancient writing. The hunger within him had temporarily receded, satisfied by the scavengers' energy and the dense ambient power of the Deep Wastes. This allowed him to focus fully on learning, on preparation for what was to come.

As he studied, he became aware of changes continuing within his transformed body—subtle but significant alterations to his structure, his capabilities, his very nature. The emptiness at his core was evolving, developing complexity within its void. The crystalline elements throughout his flesh were forming new patterns, new connections, new functions.

He was approaching Fracture more rapidly than even the Hollow Woman had predicted. The Deep Wastes' influence, combined with his successful first consumption, had accelerated his progression dramatically. Within days, perhaps even hours, he would cross the threshold into the second stage of the Forgotten Path.

Wei Liang welcomed this acceleration. Every step along the Path brought him closer to the power he needed to fulfill his purpose—to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, to reshape a system that had deemed him worthless, to become a consequence that could not be ignored or forgotten.

In the heart of corruption, surrounded by a reality that defied conventional understanding, the once-rootless disciple continued his transformation into something the cultivation world had not seen in centuries. Something they had good reason to fear. Something that remembered betrayal and promised return.

The Forgotten Path unfolded before him, and Wei Liang walked it with purpose—not merely hunger, not merely revenge, but the focused intention to become exactly what the Azure Peaks Sect deserved for what they had done to him.

A reckoning in human form. A consequence given flesh. A memory that refused to be forgotten.



# Chapter 7: Fracture

The Deep Wastes reshaped Wei Liang as surely as he reshaped himself.

Seven days had passed since their arrival in this heart of corruption—or what passed for days in a place where time flowed according to its own alien logic. Wei Liang had spent each moment in focused study and practice, absorbing the Hollow Woman's teachings and the ancient knowledge inscribed on her dwelling's walls.

The transformation accelerated with each passing hour. The crystalline structures that had begun forming throughout his flesh now dominated his physical form, replacing blood and bone with something that resembled neither. His skin had taken on a translucent quality, revealing the geometric patterns beneath—branching networks that carried void energy rather than blood through his transformed body.

His face, when he glimpsed it in reflective surfaces, had become a study in beautiful wrongness—features still recognizably his own, but altered in subtle ways that suggested something other than human. His eyes had deepened further in their sockets, now glowing with a faint inner light when he accessed the emptiness within him. His hair had turned from black to a color that had no name in any human language—something between white and transparent, catching light in impossible ways.

But the physical changes were merely external manifestations of the more profound transformation occurring within. The emptiness at his core had evolved, developing structure within its void—a crystalline lattice of nothingness that somehow maintained form despite its fundamental absence. This structured void allowed for more precise control of his abilities, more efficient processing of consumed energy, more deliberate application of the Forgotten Path's techniques.

Wei Liang sat in meditation at the center of the Hollow Woman's dwelling, his awareness turned inward to observe these changes. He stood at the threshold of Fracture—the second stage of the Forgotten Path. One final push would carry him across.

"You hesitate," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing around the edges of the impossible space. "Why?"

Wei Liang opened eyes that now resembled frozen twilight. "The inscriptions describe Fracture as the splintering of self. The division of identity to create space for greater power."

"Yes," she acknowledged. "The price of progression."

"I wish to understand exactly what I will lose," he said. "Which fragments of self must be sacrificed, and which can be preserved."

The Hollow Woman's form stilled, darkness condensing until he could almost make out features within it—a face watching him with what might have been approval.

"A wise question," she said. "Most who walk this path rush forward, heedless of specific costs until it's too late to choose what they surrender."

She moved closer, her void presence cool against his senses. "Fracture requires the splintering of identity, yes, but not its destruction. Think of it as... redistribution. Parts of yourself that were once integrated must be separated, compartmentalized, some prioritized over others."

Wei Liang considered this explanation. "Which parts?"

"That," she said, "is your choice to make. The Path demands sacrifice, but it allows the walker to choose what is sacrificed. This is both its mercy and its cruelty."

Wei Liang turned his awareness inward again, examining the self he had carried through transformation. What parts of his identity could he afford to splinter? What aspects could he surrender or diminish to make room for greater power?

His memories of the Azure Peaks Sect—the years of servitude, the casual cruelty, the constant reminders of his rootless status—these he could compartmentalize without regret. They served only as motivation, as fuel for his purpose. They need not remain integrated with his core identity.

His knowledge—cultivation techniques studied in secret, survival skills honed through necessity, understanding gained through observation—this he would preserve intact. Knowledge was tool and weapon both, essential to his purpose.

His capacity for patience, for calculation, for long-term planning—these too must remain central to his being. They had kept him alive when more impulsive responses would have led to destruction.

But what of softer aspects? The rare moments of connection with others—Master Jing's occasional kindness, Liu Mei's brief friendship, even Yun Hua's unexpected respect during the expedition. These memories carried emotional weight that complicated his purpose, suggesting a world more complex than simple oppressor and oppressed.

And what of his capacity for mercy? He had spared the scavengers Mei and Tao, sending them as messengers rather than consuming them completely. Was this weakness to be discarded, or wisdom to be preserved?

"I see your struggle," the Hollow Woman said, interrupting his contemplation. "Perhaps a different perspective would help. Consider not what to discard, but what to prioritize. What aspects of self must remain dominant for your purpose to be fulfilled?"

Wei Liang found this framing more useful. His purpose was clear: to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, to make the Azure Peaks Sect acknowledge what they had created through their actions. This required power, yes, but also identity—he must remain Wei Liang enough to be recognized, to be connected to the rootless disciple they had discarded.

"I must retain enough of who I was for them to see what I've become," he said, articulating this realization. "The connection between cause and effect must remain clear."

"An interesting priority," the Hollow Woman observed. "Most who walk this path seek to erase their former selves entirely, to become something wholly new."

"That would defeat my purpose," Wei Liang replied. "If I become something unrecognizable, something with no connection to who I was, then my return means nothing. They must see the rootless disciple in what I've become, must recognize their own handiwork."

The Hollow Woman's darkness rippled in what might have been approval. "Then you have your answer. Fracture your emotional connections to the past while preserving the memories themselves. Splinter your capacity for doubt and hesitation while maintaining strategic patience. Compartmentalize everything that does not directly serve your purpose, without necessarily destroying it."

Wei Liang nodded, understanding now what Fracture truly required. Not the destruction of self, but its reorganization—the creation of a primary identity focused entirely on purpose, with other aspects of self relegated to secondary importance.

"How do I begin?" he asked.

"By defining your core purpose with absolute clarity," she replied. "Then allowing everything else to fracture around it."

Wei Liang closed his eyes again, focusing his thoughts on his purpose. Not revenge, which was too simple, too emotional. Not power, which was means rather than end. Not even survival, which was necessary but insufficient.

Recognition. Acknowledgment. The forcing of memory upon those who would prefer to forget.

He would return to the Azure Peaks Sect not as a vengeful ghost but as a consequence incarnate. He would show them exactly what their actions had created—a being who walked the Forgotten Path because they had left him no other. He would make them see the rootless disciple in the transformed entity he had become, would force them to acknowledge the connection between their betrayal and his rebirth.

This purpose crystallized in his mind, becoming the fixed point around which everything else would reorganize. As it solidified, he felt the beginning of Fracture—a sensation like glass cracking, but within his very identity. Aspects of self that had been integrated began to separate, to compartmentalize, to redistribute according to their relevance to his core purpose.

Memories remained intact but emotional connections to them changed—some strengthening, others weakening, all reorganizing around his central intent. Capacities and traits shifted in priority—those that served his purpose moving to the foreground of his being, others receding to peripheral awareness.

The process was neither painless nor quick. Wei Liang felt each separation, each reorganization as a distinct sensation—not physical pain but something more fundamental, the discomfort of identity restructuring itself. Hours passed as the Fracture progressed, the Hollow Woman watching in silence as he underwent this critical transformation.

When it finally completed, Wei Liang opened eyes that had changed yet again—now resembling shattered twilight, pupils split into geometric patterns that somehow still functioned as organs of sight. His perception had altered, allowing him to see not just physical reality but the boundaries between aspects of existence—the seams where one state of being connected to another.

"It is done," the Hollow Woman observed. "You have crossed the threshold into Fracture."

Wei Liang rose from his meditation position, feeling his transformed body respond with new precision. The emptiness within him had changed as well—no longer a singular void but a structured network of absences, each connected to the others in complex patterns.

"I feel..." he began, then paused, searching for words to describe his altered state. "Distributed. Present in multiple ways simultaneously."

"Yes," she confirmed. "Fracture allows for divided consciousness—the ability to maintain awareness of multiple aspects of reality at once. This is the foundation for the reality manipulation that defines this stage of the Path."

Wei Liang extended his senses, testing this new capacity. He could perceive the physical space around him, the energy currents flowing through the Deep Wastes, and the boundaries between different aspects of reality—all simultaneously, without the need to shift focus from one to another.

More significantly, he could sense the connection between himself and the array site more clearly now—the tether that linked his transformation to the wound in reality. Through this connection, he perceived changes occurring at the array—crystalline structures growing from the central void, mirroring his own transformation. The corruption was spreading, accelerating in response to his progression along the Forgotten Path.

"The array," he said. "It changes as I change."

"Yes," the Hollow Woman acknowledged. "Your advancement strengthens the connection, allows more void energy to flow through the tether. The corruption will spread faster now, drawing more attention from those who monitor the Wastes."

Wei Liang absorbed this information without concern. The acceleration of corruption served his purpose—it would force the Azure Peaks Sect to recognize the consequences of their actions sooner rather than later.

"What new abilities does Fracture grant?" he asked, turning his attention to more immediate matters.

"Three primary capabilities," she replied, her form shifting as she prepared to demonstrate. "First, enhanced consumption—you can now absorb spiritual energy with greater efficiency and from greater distance. Second, reality seam manipulation—the ability to identify and exploit weaknesses in the fabric of existence. And third, fragmented projection—extending aspects of yourself beyond your physical form."

She gestured toward the dwelling's entrance. "Come. These abilities are better demonstrated than described."

Wei Liang followed her outside, into the impossible landscape of the Deep Wastes. With his enhanced perception, he now saw this environment in greater detail—the mathematical patterns that governed its seemingly chaotic nature, the energy currents that connected disparate elements into a coherent whole, the boundaries between different aspects of reality that allowed for transitions impossible in normal existence.

The Hollow Woman led him to an area where reality seemed particularly thin—a place where different aspects of existence overlapped, creating a shimmering effect visible even to normal perception.

"A reality seam," she explained. "A weakness in the boundary between different states of being. In the Deep Wastes, these occur naturally due to corruption. In the outside world, they're rare except in places of significant spiritual convergence or catastrophe."

She extended her darkness toward the seam, her void nature interacting with the boundary in ways Wei Liang could now perceive clearly. The seam responded, widening slightly to reveal glimpses of another location—a different part of the Wastes, judging by the crystalline formations visible through the opening.

"Fracture allows you to identify these seams, to widen them temporarily, and in some cases, to create them where none existed before," she continued. "This is the foundation of the Path's reality manipulation—not the creation of something from nothing, but the exploitation of existing weaknesses in the fabric of existence."

Wei Liang approached the seam, extending his awareness toward it as the Hollow Woman had done. He felt the boundary respond to his attention, recognizing the structured void within him as something compatible with its own nature. With careful intent, he pushed against the seam, widening it further until the opening was large enough for a person to step through.

"Good," the Hollow Woman approved. "Now, try to perceive what lies beyond more clearly."

Wei Liang focused his divided consciousness on the opening, one aspect of his awareness remaining with his physical form while another extended through the seam. This divided perception allowed him to see both his immediate surroundings and the location beyond the opening simultaneously—a disorienting experience at first, but one that became more manageable as he adjusted to his fractured awareness.

The location beyond appeared to be a crystalline forest, formations resembling trees but composed entirely of geometric structures that defied conventional biology. Energy flowed through these crystal trees in visible currents, connecting them into a network that suggested a form of collective consciousness.

"What is this place?" he asked, maintaining his divided perception.

"Another region of the Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman replied. "One where corruption has created rather than destroyed—a new form of existence rather than a distortion of the old. The crystal forest is a single entity distributed across multiple formations, a consciousness that exists in the spaces between individual structures."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with fascination. The Deep Wastes contained more than mere corruption—it held new possibilities, new forms of existence that transcended conventional categories.

"Can I pass through?" he asked.

"You could," she acknowledged, "but I wouldn't recommend it yet. The crystal forest is not hostile, but it is curious. It would attempt to communicate by integrating with your consciousness—an experience you're not yet prepared to process safely."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting her assessment. He released his influence on the seam, allowing it to narrow back to its natural state. The opening closed, the glimpse of the crystal forest fading from view.

"The second ability," the Hollow Woman continued, "is enhanced consumption. You've already experienced basic consumption of spiritual energy, but Fracture allows for greater range and efficiency."

She gestured toward a distant formation that resembled a mountain folded in on itself. Near its base, Wei Liang could perceive several entities—not human but not entirely alien either, forms that suggested partial transformation through prolonged exposure to corruption.

"Waste-touched," the Hollow Woman explained. "Humans who entered the Wastes and remained too long, allowing corruption to alter them gradually rather than through deliberate cultivation. They retain fragments of their original nature, including cultivated spiritual energy, but have adapted to existence here."

Wei Liang extended his senses toward these entities, perceiving their spiritual signatures more clearly than would have been possible before Fracture. Their energy patterns showed the distinctive distortions of corruption, but underlying these were recognizable cultivation bases—mostly Foundation Establishment, with one approaching Core Formation.

"Before Fracture, you could only consume energy through direct contact or close proximity," the Hollow Woman said. "Now, you can establish connections at much greater distance, drawing energy without physical presence."

She demonstrated, her darkness extending tendrils of void that stretched toward one of the distant Waste-touched. The tendrils didn't physically cross the intervening space but seemed to fold reality, creating a direct connection despite the distance. The entity stiffened as the connection formed, its corrupted spiritual energy flowing along the tendrils toward the Hollow Woman's void form.

After a brief demonstration, she severed the connection, leaving the Waste-touched weakened but alive. "Distance consumption requires more precision and control," she explained. "The connection is more tenuous, more easily disrupted by resistance or interference."

Wei Liang studied her technique, understanding the principles involved. The structured void within him could extend beyond his physical form, creating connections that bypassed normal spatial limitations. With careful intent, he replicated her demonstration, sending void tendrils toward a different Waste-touched entity.

The connection formed more easily than he expected, his fractured consciousness allowing him to maintain awareness of both his physical location and the distant target simultaneously. The Waste-touched—once human but now something with too many limbs and crystalline growths along its spine—sensed the intrusion immediately, its corrupted spiritual energy flaring in defensive patterns.

Wei Liang pushed through this resistance, establishing a firm connection to the entity's cultivation core. The spiritual energy began flowing along this connection, entering the structured void within him in a steady stream. The sensation was different from his previous consumption experiences—more refined, more controlled, more efficient.

He monitored the Waste-touched's condition carefully, not wishing to consume it completely. When he had taken approximately half its spiritual energy—enough to demonstrate the technique without causing permanent harm—he severed the connection, allowing the entity to recover.

"Well executed," the Hollow Woman observed. "You learn quickly."

"The fractured consciousness makes it easier," Wei Liang replied. "I can focus on the connection and my physical form simultaneously, maintaining control of both."

"Yes. This divided awareness is the foundation of all Fracture abilities." She moved to a different location, indicating for him to follow. "Which brings us to the third capability: fragmented projection."

They reached an area where the corruption manifested as a field of crystalline formations resembling flowers, each one a perfect geometric construction that hummed with resonant energy. The Hollow Woman positioned herself at the field's edge, her darkness expanding until it filled Wei Liang's entire field of vision.

Then, suddenly, she was in multiple locations simultaneously—her darkness divided into three distinct forms, each one a perfect copy of the original, positioned at different points around the crystal field. All three forms moved independently, interacting with different crystal flowers, yet clearly controlled by a single consciousness.

"Fragmented projection," she explained, her voice coming from all three forms at once. "The ability to extend aspects of yourself beyond your primary physical form, creating temporary manifestations that remain connected to your consciousness."

The three forms recombined, darkness flowing back into a single entity. "This is perhaps the most difficult Fracture ability to master, as it requires dividing not just awareness but presence itself. The projections are not independent entities but extensions of your fractured self, each one drawing power from your core."

Wei Liang studied the technique with his enhanced perception, understanding the principles if not yet the practical application. The structured void within the Hollow Woman had temporarily redistributed, portions of her essence flowing into the projected forms while maintaining connection to the primary consciousness.

"Try," she encouraged. "Begin with a single projection, a simple extension of presence rather than a complete copy."

Wei Liang focused on the structured void within him, identifying a portion that could be temporarily separated without compromising his primary form. With careful intent, he directed this fragment outward, extending it beyond his physical boundaries while maintaining the connection to his core consciousness.

The projection formed several meters away—not a complete copy of his physical form, but a translucent suggestion of presence, crystalline structures arranged in a humanoid shape that resembled him without fully replicating his appearance. Through his fractured consciousness, he perceived both his primary location and the projection's position simultaneously, experiencing a disorienting dual perspective.

"Good," the Hollow Woman approved. "Now, try to move the projection independently while maintaining your primary form's position."

Wei Liang focused on the divided aspects of his consciousness, directing the projection to move through the crystal field while his physical body remained stationary. The experience was strange—like controlling a limb that existed at a distance, connected to his awareness but separated from his immediate physical presence.

The projection moved as directed, gliding between crystal flowers with increasing confidence as Wei Liang adjusted to the dual perspective. He discovered that the projection could interact with its environment in limited ways—touching the crystal formations caused them to resonate in response, their humming changing pitch and intensity.

"Can the projection consume energy?" he asked, curious about the tactical applications of this ability.

"In limited amounts," the Hollow Woman replied. "The connection to your primary form restricts how much energy can be transferred. More significantly, projections are vulnerable—disrupting one can cause feedback that affects your primary consciousness."

Wei Liang absorbed this information, already considering how these new abilities might serve his purpose. Enhanced consumption would allow him to grow stronger more efficiently. Reality seam manipulation offered mobility and tactical advantages. Fragmented projection provided means to extend his influence without risking his primary form.

He recalled the projection, the translucent figure dissolving as the fragment of void returned to his core. The dual perspective collapsed back into singular awareness, though his consciousness remained fractured in its new, distributed state.

"These abilities will develop further as you grow more comfortable with Fracture," the Hollow Woman said. "For now, practice each one separately until they become instinctive rather than deliberate."

Wei Liang nodded, already planning how to incorporate these techniques into regular practice. "How long before I can progress to the next stage?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely—a rare state that indicated serious consideration. "Void is the third stage," she said finally. "It requires not just the fracturing of self but the beginning of its dissolution. The boundaries between you and the emptiness you contain start to blur. I would not recommend rushing toward it."

"Why?" Wei Liang asked, though he suspected the answer.

"Because each stage makes it more difficult to maintain your original purpose," she replied. "The further you progress, the more the Path itself becomes your purpose, consumption becoming end rather than means. If recognition remains your goal, Fracture provides sufficient power while allowing you to retain enough of your original identity to make that recognition meaningful."

Wei Liang considered this assessment. The Hollow Woman had no reason to mislead him—if anything, her centuries of existence suggested she valued his unique approach to the Path, his determination to maintain purpose beyond mere power.

"I will master Fracture fully before considering advancement," he decided. "These abilities alone offer significant advantages over traditional cultivators."

"A wise choice," she approved. "Now, let us return to the dwelling. There are specific techniques for each ability that will help you develop control more quickly."

As they walked back through the impossible landscape of the Deep Wastes, Wei Liang tested his fractured perception, dividing his awareness between multiple aspects of reality simultaneously. He could perceive the physical environment, the energy currents flowing through it, the boundaries between different states of existence, and the distant connection to the array site—all without losing track of his immediate surroundings or purpose.

This divided consciousness offered a perspective impossible for normal cultivators to achieve—a multi-faceted awareness that perceived reality not as a single unified experience but as overlapping layers of existence, each with its own patterns and possibilities. The cultivation world, with its rigid hierarchies and fixed paths, seemed increasingly limited in comparison.

Back at the Hollow Woman's dwelling, Wei Liang immersed himself in study of the advanced techniques inscribed on her walls. The ancient writing now seemed clearer to his fractured perception, revealing layers of meaning that had been obscured before. Techniques that had seemed abstract now appeared practical, their applications obvious to his evolved understanding.

Days passed in intensive practice, each one bringing greater mastery of his Fracture abilities. Wei Liang learned to identify reality seams with increasing precision, to widen them with minimal effort, and in controlled circumstances, to create minor seams where none had existed before. He refined his enhanced consumption, developing techniques to draw spiritual energy from multiple sources simultaneously, filtering and processing it with greater efficiency. His fragmented projection evolved from simple extension to more complex manifestations, eventually allowing him to create two independent projections while maintaining his primary form.

Throughout this training, the Hollow Woman provided guidance and context, her centuries of experience offering insights that the inscriptions alone could not provide. She corrected his techniques when necessary, suggested refinements when possible, and occasionally demonstrated advanced applications that showed the true potential of Fracture abilities.

On the seventh day after crossing the threshold into Fracture, Wei Liang sat in meditation, his consciousness divided between internal assessment and external awareness. The structured void within him had stabilized in its new configuration, the network of absences functioning with increasing harmony. His physical form had adapted fully to the transformation, the crystalline structures throughout his flesh now operating as naturally as organs had in his human body.

He was ready.

"You wish to return," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing into the meditation space. It wasn't a question.

"Not yet to the Azure Peaks Sect," Wei Liang clarified. "But to the outer Wastes. To begin moving toward my purpose rather than merely preparing for it."

She was silent for a moment, her form shifting in contemplation. "The White Lotus hunters will still be searching," she finally said. "They may have been joined by others now that reports of your nature have reached the cultivation world."

"Good," Wei Liang replied. "They will provide opportunities to test my abilities against genuine opposition. To grow stronger through meaningful consumption rather than practice."

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "You seek conflict deliberately. This is... unusual for one so new to the Path."

"I seek progress toward my purpose," he corrected. "Conflict is merely the most efficient route."

She made a sound that might have been amusement. "A distinction without difference, perhaps. But your reasoning is sound. Controlled confrontation will develop your abilities more quickly than isolated practice."

Wei Liang rose from his meditation position, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of multiple aspects of reality even as he focused on the conversation. "Will you accompany me?" he asked.

The question seemed to surprise her, her darkness rippling in what might have been startlement. "You wish me to continue as your guide?"

"If it serves your interests," Wei Liang replied carefully. "You've mentioned curiosity about my development. That curiosity would be better satisfied through observation than distance."

The Hollow Woman was silent again, longer this time. When she finally responded, her voice carried a quality he hadn't heard before—something almost like anticipation.

"It has been... centuries since I involved myself directly in the affairs of the cultivation world," she said. "My existence has been one of observation rather than participation. Perhaps it is time for that to change."

She flowed closer, her darkness cool against his senses. "Yes, Wei Liang. I will accompany you. My curiosity about your path remains unsatisfied, and I find myself... interested in what consequences your return might create."

Wei Liang nodded, satisfied with this arrangement. The Hollow Woman's continued guidance would be valuable, her centuries of experience providing context and strategy his own knowledge couldn't match. More significantly, her presence would complicate the cultivation world's response to his emergence—forcing them to consider not one but two practitioners of the Forgotten Path.

"When do we depart?" she asked.

"Tomorrow," Wei Liang decided. "I have one final technique to master before leaving the Deep Wastes."

"And what technique is that?"

"Reality anchor creation," he replied, referencing an advanced application of seam manipulation described in the inscriptions. "The ability to establish fixed points that can be returned to regardless of distance. It will provide... insurance against unexpected developments."

The Hollow Woman's form shifted in what might have been approval. "A prudent precaution. Few who walk the Path consider retreat as carefully as advance."

Wei Liang spent the remainder of the day practicing this final technique—identifying locations with suitable energy patterns, creating specialized seams that remained stable even when not actively maintained, and establishing connections between these anchors and his fractured consciousness. By nightfall, he had created three such anchors—one at the Hollow Woman's dwelling, one at the crystal forest glimpsed through his first seam manipulation, and one at a location of particular mathematical stability within the Deep Wastes.

These anchors would serve as emergency retreat points, allowing him to escape otherwise inescapable situations by exploiting reality seams to return to established safe locations. The technique required significant energy and couldn't be used frequently, but as a last resort, it offered survival options beyond what traditional cultivators could imagine.

As the perpetual twilight of the Deep Wastes shifted toward its deeper phase—the closest approximation to night in this corrupted reality—Wei Liang stood outside the Hollow Woman's dwelling, his fractured perception extended to its maximum range. Beyond the immediate environment, beyond the strange landscape of the Deep Wastes, he sensed the boundary that separated this heart of corruption from the outer regions. And beyond that, faintly but distinctly, he perceived the cultivation world that had discarded him—the structured energies of sects and cities, the ordered patterns of a civilization built on rigid hierarchy and fixed paths.

They had no concept of what approached them. No understanding of what their actions had created. No preparation for the consequence that now walked the Forgotten Path with deliberate purpose.

Wei Liang's fractured consciousness maintained perfect clarity about his intention. Not mere revenge, which was too simple, too emotional. Not mere destruction, which was too chaotic, too purposeless. But recognition—forced acknowledgment of the connection between their betrayal and his transformation. He would make them see exactly what their actions had wrought, would ensure they could never again discard someone as worthless without considering what that discarded person might become.

The Hollow Woman joined him outside, her darkness flowing beside him in companionable silence. After centuries of solitary existence, she had chosen to accompany him—out of curiosity, she claimed, but perhaps also out of recognition. She too had walked this path, had known what it meant to exist outside the cultivation world's rigid categories. Perhaps she saw in his purpose something that resonated with her own long-forgotten motivations.

"Tomorrow," Wei Liang said, not a question but a statement of intent.

"Tomorrow," she agreed, her darkness expanding slightly to encompass more of the twilight. "The cultivation world will remember what it tried to forget."

They stood together at the edge of corruption's heart, the once-rootless disciple and the ancient void walker, preparing to return to a world that had no place for either of them. A world that would soon learn the cost of enforcing such rigid boundaries, of discarding those who didn't fit its predetermined categories.

A world that would remember Wei Liang, whether it wished to or not.



# Chapter 8: Return to the Wastes

The boundary between the Deep Wastes and the outer regions shimmered before them, a threshold visible only to those with perception beyond normal cultivation senses. Wei Liang studied it with his fractured consciousness, observing the complex patterns of energy that defined this transition point between corruption's heart and its periphery.

"The White Lotus hunters will sense our crossing," the Hollow Woman warned, her darkness flowing beside him in the perpetual twilight. "The boundary disturbance carries a distinctive signature they're trained to recognize."

Wei Liang nodded, having anticipated this. "Good. I prefer a deliberate encounter to endless pursuit."

His transformed body had settled fully into the Fracture stage during their final day in the Deep Wastes. The crystalline structures throughout his flesh had stabilized in their new configuration, no longer spreading but instead refining, becoming more efficient in their function. His skin retained its translucent quality, revealing geometric patterns beneath that pulsed with void energy rather than blood. His face remained recognizably his own, but altered in ways that suggested something beyond human—eyes like shattered twilight, features too precisely arranged, expressions carrying an unnatural stillness.

Most significant was the change to his spiritual presence. Before transformation, he had possessed no spirit root, no cultivation potential detectable by traditional means. Now, his presence registered as a structured absence—not merely empty space but organized void, a pattern of nothingness that somehow maintained form and function. To cultivation senses, he appeared as a walking contradiction—simultaneously present and absent, existing in a state that defied conventional categorization.

"How many hunters do you sense beyond the boundary?" he asked, extending his perception as far as possible through the threshold.

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly, reaching beyond the boundary with practiced ease. "Six White Lotus hunters, positioned in a containment formation approximately two miles from our crossing point. They've established a spiritual alert array covering most of the outer Wastes' perimeter."

Wei Liang absorbed this information without concern. Six hunters presented a challenge but not an insurmountable one, especially with his newly mastered Fracture abilities. Their containment formation suggested defensive rather than offensive intent—they sought to prevent corruption from spreading rather than to eliminate its source directly.

"And beyond them?" he asked, curious about the broader response to his emergence.

"Increased activity throughout the boundary regions," she replied. "Sect patrols have doubled. Monitoring stations have been reinforced. The cultivation world has noticed the acceleration of corruption from the array site."

This, too, aligned with Wei Liang's expectations. The connection between his progression along the Forgotten Path and the spreading corruption from the array site ensured the cultivation world could not ignore his existence. Their increased vigilance would make his journey more challenging but also more meaningful—each encounter would carry greater significance, each victory would resonate more widely.

"Are you prepared for direct confrontation?" the Hollow Woman asked, her tone neutral but her form shifting in what might have been concern. "The White Lotus hunters are not ordinary cultivators. Their purification techniques are specifically designed to counter corruption-based abilities."

"I'm counting on it," Wei Liang replied. "Their specialized techniques make them ideal tests for my new capabilities. If I can overcome purification methods, traditional cultivation will pose little threat."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been amusement. "You approach conflict as methodology rather than necessity. Interesting."

Wei Liang didn't correct this assessment. Conflict was indeed methodology to him now—each encounter a controlled experiment, each opponent a measure of his progress. His fractured consciousness maintained perfect clarity about this instrumental approach to violence, separating it entirely from emotional responses like anger or fear.

"Shall we proceed?" he asked, ready to cross the boundary.

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "One final warning," she said. "The outer Wastes will feel... constrained after the Deep Wastes. Reality there follows more conventional rules, limiting some applications of your Fracture abilities. Adjust your expectations accordingly."

Wei Liang nodded, having anticipated this transition. The Deep Wastes' fluid reality had allowed for expansive expression of his new capabilities, but the outer regions would impose greater restrictions, requiring more precise control and more efficient application.

With this understanding, he stepped forward, approaching the boundary with deliberate intent. His fractured consciousness maintained awareness of multiple aspects of reality simultaneously—his physical form, the energy patterns surrounding him, the structured void within him, and the distant connection to the array site. This divided perception allowed him to monitor the boundary's response to his approach, to adjust his void nature to facilitate smooth transition.

The threshold resisted briefly, corruption's heart reluctant to release one who had adapted so thoroughly to its alien environment. Wei Liang pushed through this resistance with careful application of his structured void, creating temporary harmony between his transformed nature and the boundary's energy patterns. The resistance faded, allowing him to step through into the outer Wastes.

The Hollow Woman followed, her darkness flowing through the threshold with practiced ease. She reformed beside him, her void presence somehow more substantial in this less corrupted environment—darkness with greater definition, greater weight against reality's fabric.

Wei Liang immediately sensed the difference the Hollow Woman had warned about. The outer Wastes felt more rigid, more defined by conventional physical laws despite the corruption that permeated everything. Reality here bent rather than broke, distorted rather than transformed completely. His Fracture abilities remained accessible but would require more energy, more precision to achieve the same effects.

More significantly, he sensed the White Lotus hunters' spiritual alert array—a network of purification techniques spread across the perimeter, designed to detect and locate corruption manifestations. His emergence had triggered this array, sending pulses of spiritual energy toward the hunters' position. They would know exactly where he had crossed and would be moving to intercept within minutes.

"They've detected us," the Hollow Woman observed unnecessarily. "Their response formation is shifting from containment to interception."

Wei Liang nodded, already adjusting his strategy for the coming encounter. "How long before they arrive?"

"Twenty minutes at most," she replied. "They move quickly through corrupted terrain, their purification techniques creating temporary safe passages."

This timeframe suited Wei Liang's purpose. It allowed for preparation without extended waiting, for strategic positioning without complex maneuvering. He surveyed their immediate surroundings, identifying tactical advantages in the corrupted landscape.

They had emerged in a region where corruption manifested as distorted geography—valleys that curved at impossible angles, hills that seemed to occupy more space than their dimensions should allow, vegetation that grew in patterns suggesting conscious design rather than natural development. Approximately half a mile ahead, a formation of crystalline spires rose from the distorted terrain, their structure similar to the crystal pavilion where Wei Liang had first encountered the Hollow Woman.

"There," he decided, indicating the crystal formation. "High ground, clear sightlines, and crystalline resonance that will amplify void techniques."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been approval. "A sound choice. The formation's corruption signature will also mask your presence until they're quite close, preventing long-range purification attacks."

They moved toward the crystal spires, traversing the distorted landscape with the ease of those adapted to corruption's influence. Wei Liang's transformed body responded to his will with perfect precision, each movement calculated for maximum efficiency. His fractured consciousness maintained awareness of their surroundings, the hunters' approaching formation, and the tactical possibilities offered by the corrupted environment.

As they reached the crystal formation, Wei Liang extended his senses to study it more carefully. Unlike the pavilion, these spires had no inscriptions, no ancient knowledge preserved in their structure. They were purely natural formations—if anything in the Wastes could be called natural—created through corruption's influence on ordinary stone over centuries.

The crystalline material resonated with void energy, responding to Wei Liang's presence with subtle harmonics that strengthened his connection to the structured emptiness within him. This resonance would indeed amplify his Fracture abilities, particularly those involving direct manipulation of void energy.

"They approach from the southwest," the Hollow Woman reported, her darkness extending tendrils of perception beyond normal range. "Six hunters in arrow formation, led by one at Core Formation. The others are at Foundation Establishment, but their purification techniques compensate for their lower cultivation bases."

Wei Liang positioned himself at the formation's center, where the resonance was strongest. "Will you participate in this encounter?" he asked the Hollow Woman, curious about her intentions.

Her darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "I will observe unless your survival is threatened," she replied. "This is your test, your methodology. My intervention would contaminate the results."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting this decision. He preferred to face the hunters alone anyway—to measure his progress precisely, without external factors complicating the assessment. The Hollow Woman's presence as observer rather than participant would provide valuable perspective without altering the encounter's dynamics.

"They will attempt to contain before attacking," she added, offering a final insight. "White Lotus doctrine prioritizes corruption containment over elimination when possible. They will try to establish a purification array around you, to sever your connection to the void before attempting direct confrontation."

This tactical information was useful. Wei Liang adjusted his strategy accordingly, planning to disrupt their array establishment rather than waiting for direct engagement. Preemptive action would force them to abandon their preferred approach, creating uncertainty that he could exploit.

"Withdraw to a safe observation position," he instructed the Hollow Woman. "I'll handle this encounter alone."

Her darkness flowed away from the crystal formation's center, finding position among the outer spires where she could observe without being immediately detected. "Remember," she said before fully withdrawing, "purification techniques target the connection between practitioner and void. Protect that connection above all else."

With this final advice, she faded from immediate perception, her void presence masked by the crystal formation's natural corruption signature. Wei Liang was effectively alone, awaiting the hunters' arrival with the patient focus that had defined his existence even before transformation.

He didn't wait long. Within minutes, he sensed the hunters' approach—six distinct spiritual signatures moving in precise formation through the corrupted landscape. Their energy carried the distinctive resonance of purification techniques, designed to cleanse corruption rather than merely resist it. To Wei Liang's enhanced perception, they appeared as points of searing light cutting through the Wastes' perpetual twilight.

He remained motionless at the formation's center, allowing his void presence to harmonize with the crystalline resonance. This harmony masked his exact location while amplifying his connection to the structured emptiness within him. When the hunters established their purification array, he would be at his strongest, ready to counter their techniques with precisely applied void energy.

The hunters reached the formation's perimeter, their spiritual senses probing the crystalline spires for corruption signatures. Wei Liang observed them through his fractured perception—six figures in white robes marked with lotus emblems, their faces concealed behind purification masks that filtered the Wastes' corrupted essence. They moved with the coordinated precision of those who had trained together for years, each one maintaining perfect position relative to the others.

Their leader, the Core Formation cultivator, raised a hand to halt the formation. "The corruption signature is concentrated within the crystal structure," he announced, his voice carrying the resonant quality of one who had integrated sound into his cultivation technique. "Establish the purification array at twenty-pace intervals. Sequence four."

The hunters began positioning themselves around the crystal formation, preparing to establish their containment array. Wei Liang watched through fractured consciousness as they placed purification talismans at precise intervals, creating a geometric pattern designed to isolate corruption from its void source.

He waited until they had committed fully to their array establishment—until retreat would be more costly than continuation—before making his presence known. With deliberate intent, he released the harmony between his void nature and the crystalline resonance, allowing his transformed presence to emerge from concealment like a shadow suddenly illuminated.

The hunters sensed this emergence immediately, their spiritual awareness registering the structured void at the formation's center. Their coordinated movements faltered briefly—a moment of surprise despite their training—before resuming with increased urgency.

"Void practitioner detected!" the leader called, his voice carrying both warning and command. "Complete the array! Priority one containment!"

Wei Liang rose from his seated position, his transformed body moving with inhuman grace among the crystal spires. He made no attempt to attack or flee, simply revealing himself fully to the hunters' perception. Let them see exactly what approached them—not mindless corruption but deliberate transformation, not chaotic void but structured emptiness.

The hunters responded to his appearance with practiced discipline, completing their positioning despite his revealed presence. Their purification talismans activated simultaneously, creating a barrier of searing light that encircled the crystal formation. This barrier began contracting immediately, designed to compress the contained space until the void practitioner within had nowhere to draw power from.

Wei Liang observed this technique with analytical interest, his fractured consciousness perceiving both the physical barrier and the spiritual principles underlying it. The purification energy targeted the connection between practitioner and void, attempting to sever the channel through which emptiness flowed into structured form.

Against a traditional void cultivator, this approach would be effective—perhaps even fatal. But Wei Liang was not traditional. The emptiness existed within him now, integrated into his transformed being rather than accessed through external connection. The purification barrier might contain him physically, but it could not sever what had become intrinsic to his nature.

He allowed the barrier to contract further, curious how the hunters would respond when their primary technique proved ineffective. The searing light closed to within twenty paces of his position, its purification energy attempting to cleanse the corruption that sustained void practices. Wei Liang felt this energy wash over him, seeking connections to sever, channels to close—and finding none that matched its expected patterns.

The hunters' leader noticed this failure first, his spiritual senses more refined than his companions'. "Anomaly detected," he reported, voice tight with controlled concern. "Subject is not externally connected to void. Repeat, no external connection detected."

This observation spread visible uncertainty through the hunter formation. Their training had prepared them for conventional void practitioners—cultivators who accessed emptiness through established techniques, who drew power from the connection between self and void. Wei Liang's integrated emptiness represented something outside their experience, something their containment approach could not effectively counter.

The leader adapted quickly, adjusting their strategy with the decisiveness of experienced command. "Shift to purification assault," he ordered. "Formation six, direct application."

The hunters abandoned their containment approach, repositioning for direct engagement. Their formation tightened, becoming offensive rather than restrictive. From talismans and specialized weapons, they drew purification energy in concentrated form—white fire that burned corruption without consuming physical matter.

Wei Liang watched this transition with continued analytical interest. Direct purification assault represented a more significant threat than containment, potentially capable of damaging his transformed being if applied with sufficient intensity. This would be a meaningful test of his Fracture abilities, a true measure of his progress along the Forgotten Path.

The hunters attacked simultaneously, white fire streaming from their weapons toward Wei Liang's position at the formation's center. The purification energy moved with unnatural precision, adjusting its trajectory to counter his slightest movement, seeking not just his physical form but the emptiness integrated within it.

Wei Liang responded with his first active application of Fracture abilities. His consciousness divided, one aspect maintaining awareness of his physical form while another extended beyond it, identifying reality seams within the crystal formation. These seams—weaknesses in existence's fabric—appeared to his enhanced perception as faint lines connecting different aspects of reality.

With precise intent, he widened the nearest seam just as the purification energy reached him. The white fire passed through the space he had occupied, finding nothing as Wei Liang stepped sideways through the widened seam, emerging ten paces from his original position. To the hunters, it appeared as though he had simply vanished, their attack passing through empty air.

"Spatial displacement!" the leader warned, adjusting their formation again. "Track void signature, not physical form!"

The hunters responded with impressive coordination, their spiritual senses shifting focus from Wei Liang's visible presence to the void energy that defined his transformed nature. This adaptation allowed them to track him despite his reality manipulation, their next attack converging on his new position with only minimal delay.

Wei Liang widened another seam, again displacing himself just before the purification energy could connect. This time, however, he didn't merely evade—he countered. As he emerged from the seam, he extended void tendrils toward the nearest hunter, initiating enhanced consumption from twenty paces distance.

The hunter—a young woman with Foundation Establishment cultivation—sensed the connection forming too late to prevent it. Her spiritual energy responded defensively, purification techniques flaring to counter corruption's influence. But Wei Liang's consumption bypassed these defenses, targeting not her techniques but the cultivation base that powered them.

Her spiritual energy began flowing along the void tendrils, entering the structured emptiness within Wei Liang in a steady stream. The sensation was different from consuming the scavengers or the Waste-touched—her energy carried the distinctive resonance of purification techniques, a searing quality that required careful processing.

The hunter collapsed to one knee, her purification mask falling away to reveal a face contorted in shock and pain. "He's consuming directly!" she gasped, warning her companions. "Cultivation drain!"

The leader responded immediately, directing two hunters to protect their weakened companion while the remaining three intensified their assault on Wei Liang. Their attacks became more varied, combining purification energy with traditional combat techniques—sword formations that created patterns of white fire, talisman deployments that generated purifying mist, sound techniques that disrupted void resonance.

Wei Liang severed his consumption connection to the weakened hunter, having taken enough of her spiritual energy to strengthen himself without risking her life. Killing White Lotus hunters would escalate the cultivation world's response beyond what served his current purpose—better to demonstrate his capabilities while leaving survivors to report what they had encountered.

He faced the intensified assault with the full range of his Fracture abilities. Reality seam manipulation allowed him to displace repeatedly, appearing and vanishing across the crystal formation with disorienting frequency. Enhanced consumption let him establish brief connections with multiple hunters simultaneously, taking small amounts of spiritual energy from each to prevent any single target from being completely drained. Fragmented projection created translucent duplicates that confused targeting and divided the hunters' attention.

The leader recognized the nature of these abilities with the insight of experienced combat. "Fracture techniques!" he called to his companions. "Subject has reached second stage progression! Priority shifted to containment and retreat!"

This assessment confirmed Wei Liang's own evaluation of his progress. The White Lotus hunters—specialists in countering void practices—had identified his capabilities accurately, recognizing both his stage of advancement and the threat it represented. Their shift from elimination to containment and retreat indicated they understood they were outmatched despite their specialized training.

Wei Liang could have prevented their retreat, could have consumed them completely to accelerate his own advancement. But such actions would not serve his larger purpose. Better to allow survivors who could accurately report what they had encountered, who could spread precise knowledge of his capabilities throughout the cultivation world.

He maintained pressure on the hunter formation, using Fracture abilities to disrupt their coordination without delivering fatal attacks. His void tendrils established and severed connections rapidly, taking small amounts of spiritual energy from each hunter to demonstrate his consumption capability without permanently damaging their cultivation bases. His reality manipulation created the impression of omnipresence within the crystal formation, appearing wherever their defenses weakened.

The hunters retreated in stages, maintaining formation discipline despite their clear disadvantage. Two supported the companion Wei Liang had initially targeted, her cultivation base significantly diminished but not destroyed. The others provided covering techniques, purification energy deployed defensively rather than offensively to secure their withdrawal.

Wei Liang allowed this retreat to proceed without interference, watching through fractured consciousness as the hunters withdrew from the crystal formation. Their spiritual signatures receded into the corrupted landscape, moving with the urgency of those who understood the danger they had narrowly escaped.

When they had passed beyond immediate range, the Hollow Woman emerged from her observation position, her darkness flowing toward Wei Liang at the formation's center. "An efficient demonstration," she observed, her tone carrying something like approval. "You controlled the encounter precisely."

Wei Liang nodded, absorbing the spiritual energy he had consumed from the hunters. Their purification techniques had imbued their cultivation with distinctive qualities—energy that burned against the emptiness within him, requiring careful processing to integrate without damage. This purification energy would strengthen his resistance to similar techniques in future encounters, an adaptation that would prove valuable as the cultivation world's response escalated.

"They will report a second-stage void practitioner," the Hollow Woman continued. "This will trigger specific protocols among the major sects. The response will intensify significantly."

"Good," Wei Liang replied. "Each escalation brings us closer to the Azure Peaks Sect's direct involvement."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been curiosity. "You could have consumed them completely. Why didn't you?"

"Dead hunters tell no tales," Wei Liang answered simply. "I want the cultivation world to know exactly what approaches them—not mindless corruption but deliberate transformation, not random destruction but purposeful return."

She made a sound that might have been amusement. "You use restraint as strategy rather than morality. Interesting."

Wei Liang didn't correct this assessment. Morality as traditionally understood had fractured along with his identity, compartmentalized as something peripheral to his core purpose. What remained was purely instrumental reasoning—actions evaluated solely by their contribution to his ultimate goal.

"Where will we go now?" the Hollow Woman asked. "The White Lotus will establish a perimeter around this region, making further travel in this direction difficult."

Wei Liang considered their options, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of multiple strategic considerations simultaneously. "Northeast," he decided. "Toward the boundary between the Wastes and Azure Peaks territory. Not to enter their domain yet, but to establish presence near enough to draw their attention specifically."

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "The boundary is heavily monitored. We will encounter more than just White Lotus hunters there."

"I'm counting on it," Wei Liang replied. "Each encounter builds the narrative, creates the anticipation. By the time I actually enter Azure Peaks territory, they will have heard dozens of reports, each one confirming my nature, my capabilities, my approach. The recognition will be more complete for the waiting."

She made another sound of amusement. "You craft your return as performance rather than merely action. The theatrical sensibility of one who understands the power of anticipation."

Wei Liang accepted this observation without comment. His approach was indeed calculated for maximum impact—each encounter designed to build the cultivation world's awareness of his existence, each demonstration of his abilities crafted to create specific impressions among those who would report them. By the time he reached the Azure Peaks Sect itself, they would have constructed a complete picture of what approached them—a picture he controlled through careful staging of each appearance.

They departed the crystal formation, moving northeast through the corrupted landscape. Wei Liang's transformed body adapted easily to the Wastes' distorted terrain, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of both immediate surroundings and distant objectives. The Hollow Woman flowed beside him, her darkness occasionally extending to scout the path ahead or monitor potential threats behind.

As they traveled, Wei Liang processed the spiritual energy consumed from the White Lotus hunters, integrating it into the structured emptiness within him. The purification qualities required careful handling, their searing nature potentially damaging if absorbed too quickly. He filtered these qualities through his fractured consciousness, preserving the useful aspects—resistance to purification techniques, understanding of White Lotus methods—while discarding elements that might disrupt his void nature.

By nightfall—or what passed for night in the Wastes' perpetual twilight—they had covered significant distance, moving deeper into the corrupted territory that separated the heart of the Wastes from the cultivation world's domains. They established temporary position in a region where corruption manifested as inverted gravity, creating formations that defied conventional physics—stones that floated in perfect stillness, water that flowed upward in spiraling patterns, vegetation that grew in all directions simultaneously.

"We should rest," the Hollow Woman suggested, her darkness settling into a defined space among the floating stones. "Even transformed beings require recovery periods, especially after significant energy consumption and processing."

Wei Liang acknowledged the wisdom in this suggestion. His transformed body didn't experience fatigue in the traditional sense, but his fractured consciousness required periodic integration—time to process consumed energy fully, to refine control of his Fracture abilities, to maintain the balance between purpose and power that defined his progression along the Forgotten Path.

He positioned himself within a formation of floating stones, their arrangement creating a natural shelter against both physical threats and spiritual detection. The inverted gravity in this region would confuse conventional tracking methods, making their location difficult to pinpoint even for specialized hunters.

As Wei Liang settled into meditative stillness, his fractured consciousness remained partially active, maintaining awareness of their surroundings while focusing primarily on internal refinement. The structured emptiness within him had evolved further during the encounter with the White Lotus hunters, the network of absences becoming more complex, more efficient in its function.

The Hollow Woman maintained her own form of rest nearby, her darkness contracting to its most defined state—almost solid in appearance, though still fundamentally void in nature. She had existed for centuries in this transformed state, had mastered the balance between activity and recovery that sustained long-term progression along the Forgotten Path.

"The cultivation world will respond more systematically now," she observed after a period of silence. "The White Lotus hunters will share information with the major sects, coordinating their approach rather than acting independently."

Wei Liang absorbed this assessment without concern. "Systematic response means predictable patterns. Predictable patterns can be exploited more efficiently than chaotic reactions."

"True," she acknowledged. "Though their coordination will make individual encounters more challenging. You may face combined techniques designed specifically to counter Fracture abilities."

"Good," Wei Liang replied. "Each specialized counter they develop reveals more about their understanding of the Path—and their limitations in confronting it."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been approval. "You approach conflict as education rather than merely challenge. This perspective serves progression well."

They lapsed into silence again, each focused on their own recovery processes. Wei Liang's meditation deepened, his fractured consciousness integrating the day's experiences into his evolved understanding of the Forgotten Path. The encounter with the White Lotus hunters had provided valuable insights into both his own capabilities and the cultivation world's response patterns—knowledge that would inform his strategy moving forward.

As the Wastes' twilight shifted toward its deeper phase, Wei Liang sensed a disturbance in the corrupted landscape surrounding their position. Not hunters or cultivators, but something native to the Wastes itself—a presence that moved through corruption as naturally as fish through water.

The Hollow Woman sensed it too, her darkness expanding slightly in response. "Waste-born," she identified, her tone carrying neither concern nor alarm. "A consciousness formed directly from corruption rather than transformed from existing entity."

Wei Liang extended his perception toward this presence, curious about its nature. To his fractured consciousness, it appeared as a complex pattern of corrupted energy—not void-based like his own transformation, but something that had emerged from corruption's influence on reality itself. It had no physical form in conventional terms, existing instead as a localized distortion in the Wastes' already distorted environment.

"Is it sentient?" he asked, studying the pattern's movements.

"After a fashion," the Hollow Woman replied. "Not consciousness as humans understand it, but awareness with purpose and memory. This one appears to be a boundary entity—it monitors transitions between different regions of the Wastes."

The Waste-born approached their position with what seemed like curiosity, its energy pattern shifting to examine the unusual presences it had detected. It paid particular attention to Wei Liang, perhaps recognizing the structured void within him as something both familiar and foreign to its corruption-based existence.

"It's studying you," the Hollow Woman observed. "Waste-born rarely encounter void practitioners, especially those at Fracture stage. You represent a pattern it hasn't categorized before."

Wei Liang maintained stillness, allowing the entity to satisfy its curiosity without perceiving threat. His fractured consciousness studied it in return, analyzing its composition, its movement patterns, its apparent purpose. Understanding the Wastes' native entities might prove valuable as they traveled deeper into corrupted territory.

After several minutes of mutual observation, the Waste-born withdrew, its energy pattern fading into the surrounding corruption. It had apparently categorized them to its satisfaction, determining they represented neither threat nor opportunity requiring response.

"It will remember us," the Hollow Woman said once the entity had departed. "Waste-born share information through corruption currents. Others of its kind will recognize our patterns if we encounter them."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. "Can they be communicated with? Influenced?"

"To limited extent," she replied. "They respond to pattern recognition rather than language. Demonstrate patterns they associate with benefit or harmony, and they may assist rather than merely observe. Show patterns they link to disruption or threat, and they will actively avoid or interfere."

This insight suggested potential strategic advantages. If Waste-born could be influenced to recognize Wei Liang's void pattern as harmonious with corruption, they might provide indirect assistance—distracting pursuers, obscuring tracks, perhaps even misleading hunters about his location or direction.

"Something to explore further," he noted, filing this possibility for future consideration.

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been agreement. "The Wastes contain many such entities—some simple like this boundary monitor, others complex enough to rival human consciousness. Learning to interact with them effectively can provide significant advantages when navigating corrupted territories."

Their conversation faded into comfortable silence as the deeper phase of twilight settled fully around them. Wei Liang returned to meditative stillness, his fractured consciousness processing the day's experiences while maintaining peripheral awareness of their surroundings. The structured emptiness within him continued its refinement, adapting to the spiritual energy consumed from the White Lotus hunters, integrating purification resistance into its fundamental nature.

Tomorrow they would continue northeast, moving closer to the boundary between the Wastes and Azure Peaks territory. Each step would bring Wei Liang closer to his ultimate purpose—the forced recognition from those who had abandoned him, the acknowledgment of connection between their betrayal and his transformation. The cultivation world had discarded the rootless disciple as worthless; they would soon confront the consequence of that judgment in form they could neither ignore nor forget.

As Wei Liang's meditation deepened, his consciousness divided between recovery and awareness, planning and processing, he maintained perfect clarity about this purpose. Not revenge, which was too simple, too emotional. Not destruction, which was too chaotic, too purposeless. But recognition—forced acknowledgment of the connection between their actions and his transformation. He would make them see exactly what their betrayal had created, would ensure they could never again discard someone without considering what that discarded person might become.

The Forgotten Path unfolded before him, and Wei Liang walked it with deliberate intent—each step bringing him closer to the reckoning he had promised, the return they had never anticipated, the recognition they could no longer deny.



# Chapter 9: Whispers of the Forgotten

Word spread through the cultivation world like ripples in still water.

A void practitioner had emerged from the Wastes—not a mindless corruption entity but something that maintained purpose and identity despite walking the Forgotten Path. Reports from White Lotus hunters described abilities beyond conventional understanding—reality manipulation, distance consumption, fragmented projection. The practitioner had reached Fracture stage, the second level of void progression, suggesting deliberate advancement rather than accidental transformation.

Most disturbing of all, the entity traveled with a companion—a darkness that moved like liquid shadow, a void presence ancient enough to have mastered its nature completely. The hunters had identified this second entity as potentially centuries old, its abilities beyond their capacity to counter or even fully comprehend.

These reports reached the Azure Peaks Sect three days after Wei Liang's encounter with the White Lotus hunters. Elder Shen received them in her private meditation chamber, her ageless face betraying no emotion as the messenger—a junior disciple assigned to communication duties—delivered the sealed document from the White Lotus Temple.

"That will be all," she dismissed the messenger with a gesture, waiting until the young woman had departed before breaking the purification seal on the document.

The report contained detailed descriptions of the void practitioner's appearance and abilities, compiled from survivor testimonies and spiritual impressions recorded by specialized talismans. Elder Shen read these descriptions with growing concern, her centuries of cultivation experience allowing her to recognize implications beyond what the White Lotus hunters themselves had understood.

The physical description—crystalline structures visible beneath translucent skin, eyes like shattered twilight, movements suggesting inhuman precision—matched no known corruption entity cataloged in sect records. The abilities demonstrated—reality seam manipulation, enhanced consumption, fragmented projection—confirmed Fracture stage progression along the Forgotten Path, a level of advancement that should have been impossible for a new practitioner to achieve so quickly.

Most concerning was the controlled nature of the entity's actions. It had deliberately spared the hunters when it could have consumed them completely, had demonstrated abilities with precision rather than chaotic application, had shown strategic restraint suggesting long-term planning rather than immediate gratification. These behaviors contradicted everything known about void practitioners, who typically lost coherent purpose as they progressed along the Forgotten Path.

Elder Shen set the document aside, her expression thoughtful as she considered potential responses. The Azure Peaks Sect maintained responsibility for the northeastern boundary of the Wastes, a territory that included the region where the void practitioner had been encountered. This placed primary response obligation on their shoulders, requiring action beyond merely monitoring the situation.

She rose from her meditation position, moving to the communication array that connected her chamber to other sect leaders. With practiced gestures, she activated the array, establishing connection to the sect's Inner Council.

"Emergency session required," she spoke into the array, her voice carrying the authority of centuries. "Priority one. Void practitioner emergence in our boundary territory."

The array acknowledged her command, spiritual energy flowing through established channels to notify council members of the required gathering. Within minutes, confirmations began returning—senior elders and specialized masters acknowledging the summons and indicating their imminent arrival.

Elder Shen prepared the council chamber personally, arranging purification talismans at strategic intervals around the room. If they were to discuss void practitioners, basic precautions against corruption influence were prudent—especially given the unusual nature of the entity described in the White Lotus report.

The Inner Council assembled quickly, seven figures in formal sect robes taking positions around the circular table at the chamber's center. Elder Shen, as both summoner and senior member, occupied the primary position, the White Lotus report placed before her.

"I've called this emergency session," she began without preamble, "to address a significant threat emerging from the Wastes. Three days ago, White Lotus hunters encountered a void practitioner at Fracture stage, accompanied by what appears to be an ancient void entity of unknown capabilities."

She pushed the report toward the center of the table, allowing other council members to examine its contents. "The practitioner demonstrated abilities consistent with deliberate progression along the Forgotten Path rather than accidental transformation. More concerning, it showed strategic restraint and purposeful action—characteristics inconsistent with typical void corruption."

Master Feng, the sect's boundary defense specialist, was first to respond after reviewing the report. "The description suggests a human cultivator transformed through void practices rather than a native corruption entity," he observed, his weathered face grave. "The question becomes: who would deliberately walk the Forgotten Path, knowing its consequences?"

"Someone with nothing to lose," suggested Master Liu, the sect's eldest female cultivator after Elder Shen herself. "Or someone who believed the power gained outweighed the cost to identity."

Elder Shen nodded, acknowledging both possibilities while considering a third she had not yet voiced—someone who had discovered the Path through circumstances beyond their control, perhaps during a mission into the Wastes itself. This possibility carried uncomfortable implications for the sect, particularly given recent expeditions into corrupted territories.

"The entity's companion concerns me more than the practitioner itself," noted Master Zhao, the sect's lore keeper. "A void presence ancient enough to have mastered its nature completely suggests a being from the cataclysm era—perhaps even one of the original void walkers from before the Wastes' formation."

This observation sent a ripple of unease through the council. The cataclysm that had created the Wastes occurred over a thousand years ago, when experiments in reality manipulation had torn the fabric of existence, allowing void to enter the world directly. Most entities from that era had been eliminated during the subsequent purification wars—or so the cultivation world believed.

"If an original void walker has emerged," Master Feng said, voicing the council's collective concern, "then the threat extends beyond our boundary responsibilities. This would require coordinated response from all major sects."

Elder Shen raised a hand, tempering this reaction. "Let's not escalate beyond evidence," she cautioned. "The companion entity may be centuries old rather than millennia. Ancient by our standards, but not necessarily from the cataclysm itself."

She returned their attention to more immediate concerns. "The void practitioner was moving northeast when encountered—toward our territory specifically. This suggests deliberate targeting rather than random movement."

"Why would a void practitioner target Azure Peaks specifically?" asked Master Wu, the sect's youngest council member. "We maintain purification barriers along our entire boundary with the Wastes. Other sects with weaker protections would offer easier access to the cultivation world."

Elder Shen had been considering this question since receiving the report. "Perhaps it's not our sect being targeted, but something within our territory. The northeastern boundary includes several significant spiritual convergence points that might attract void practitioners seeking to strengthen their connection to emptiness."

This explanation satisfied most council members, though Elder Shen noted Master Liu's thoughtful expression suggested she had reached similar private conclusions to her own—that the targeting might be more specific, more personal than mere strategic advantage.

"What response do you propose?" Master Feng asked, returning the discussion to practical matters.

Elder Shen had prepared her recommendations carefully. "Three-tiered approach. First, increase boundary patrols with specialized purification teams—not to engage the void practitioner directly but to monitor movement and prevent boundary crossing. Second, dispatch investigation teams to the encounter site and surrounding regions—we need more information about this entity's nature and capabilities. Third, activate the sect's emergency array network to provide early warning should the void practitioner attempt to enter our territory."

The council considered these recommendations briefly before offering unanimous approval. The proposed response was proportional to the threat without committing excessive resources that might be needed elsewhere.

"One additional measure," Master Liu suggested. "We should review recent mission records for any anomalies or incidents in the Wastes. If this void practitioner was once human, there might be connection to lost disciples or failed expeditions."

Elder Shen nodded, acknowledging the wisdom in this suggestion while maintaining neutral expression. She had already begun this review privately, focusing particularly on the expedition led by inner disciple Feng Zhao—the last mission into the deeper Wastes before reports of accelerated corruption began emerging.

"Master Wu will coordinate that review," she decided, assigning the task to the council's youngest member. "Report findings directly to me, regardless of significance."

With response measures decided, the council moved to implementation details—assigning specific cultivators to boundary patrol and investigation teams, establishing communication protocols, preparing specialized equipment for void containment if direct confrontation became necessary. Elder Shen participated in these discussions with her usual precision and authority, revealing nothing of her private concerns about the void practitioner's possible identity.

When the council session concluded, Elder Shen returned to her private chambers rather than immediately overseeing implementation. She activated personal wards around the room, ensuring complete privacy before retrieving a specialized communication talisman from a hidden compartment in her meditation platform.

This talisman—one of only three in existence—established direct connection to inner disciple Feng Zhao, currently leading a training mission in the sect's northern territories. The connection formed immediately, suggesting he had been expecting her contact.

"Elder," Feng Zhao's voice emerged from the talisman, carrying the appropriate deference despite the private channel.

"A void practitioner has emerged from the Wastes," Elder Shen stated without preamble. "Fracture stage. Moving northeast toward our territory."

A moment of silence followed this announcement. When Feng Zhao responded, his voice carried carefully controlled tension. "Description?"

"Crystalline structures visible beneath translucent skin. Eyes like shattered twilight. Movements suggesting inhuman precision." Elder Shen paused before adding the detail that had most concerned her. "Demonstrated strategic restraint and purposeful action despite void corruption."

Another silence, longer this time. "It can't be him," Feng Zhao finally said, his tone suggesting he was trying to convince himself as much as her. "He had no spirit root, no cultivation potential. Even if he somehow survived, he couldn't have progressed to Fracture stage so quickly."

"The Forgotten Path doesn't require conventional cultivation potential," Elder Shen reminded him. "It requires only emptiness and will. He had both in abundance."

"I confirmed his death," Feng Zhao insisted. "The array activation consumed him completely. There was nothing left to transform."

Elder Shen had reviewed Feng Zhao's mission report multiple times since receiving the White Lotus document. The details had been precise, the evidence seemingly conclusive—rootless disciple Wei Liang had died activating an ancient array, his body consumed by void energy released during the process. The report had been accepted without question, the loss of a rootless disciple considered regrettable but acceptable given the mission's overall success.

"Perhaps," she acknowledged, neither confirming nor challenging his assertion. "Nevertheless, prepare your disciples for immediate return to the sect. If this void practitioner does approach our territory, we will need every capable cultivator for defense."

"Yes, Elder," Feng Zhao replied, his voice steadier now. "We can return within three days."

"Two," she corrected. "Use transportation talismans if necessary."

The connection terminated, Elder Shen returned the talisman to its hidden compartment. She remained seated in meditation position, her ageless face betraying nothing of her inner thoughts as she considered implications and contingencies.

If the void practitioner was indeed Wei Liang—transformed rather than destroyed by the array activation—then his movement toward Azure Peaks territory suggested purpose beyond mere corruption spread. Revenge would be the obvious motivation, particularly directed toward Feng Zhao, whose report had detailed the circumstances of the rootless disciple's "death" without mentioning the betrayal that Elder Shen had long suspected but never confirmed.

Such personal motivation from a void practitioner contradicted established understanding of the Forgotten Path's effects on identity. Conventional wisdom held that progression beyond Hollowborn stage eroded specific memories and motivations, replacing them with generalized hunger and corruption spread. A void practitioner maintaining focused purpose through Fracture stage represented something unprecedented—and potentially more dangerous than random corruption.

Elder Shen rose from her meditation position, decision made. She would proceed as if the void practitioner was indeed Wei Liang, preparing specific countermeasures while maintaining public position that the entity was unknown in origin. This approach balanced prudent preparation with avoiding unnecessary panic among sect disciples who had known the rootless disciple.

She moved to her private library, selecting texts that detailed the Forgotten Path's progression stages and known weaknesses. If confrontation became inevitable, she would be prepared with every available countermeasure—both conventional purification techniques and specialized methods developed during her centuries of cultivation experience.

As she studied these ancient texts, Elder Shen allowed herself a moment of reflection on the rootless disciple she had assigned to Feng Zhao's expedition. Wei Liang had been unusual even among rootless disciples—more observant, more patient, more determined than most who lacked spirit roots. She had noted his potential for non-cultivation roles within the sect, had considered assigning him to lore keeping or boundary monitoring once he reached appropriate age.

Instead, she had included him in Feng Zhao's expedition as balance—a reminder to the arrogant inner disciple that even the rootless had value within the sect's structure. If Wei Liang had indeed survived and transformed, if he now approached as void practitioner rather than rootless disciple, then her decision had created consequences none could have anticipated.

Elder Shen closed the ancient text, her expression resolute. Whatever approached from the Wastes—whether transformed disciple or unknown entity—would find Azure Peaks Sect prepared. Her centuries of cultivation had taught her that anticipation was the strongest defense, that preparation often determined outcome before conflict even began.

She activated the communication array again, this time connecting to Master Feng. "Implement boundary patrol increases immediately," she instructed. "Priority focus on northeastern quadrant. Purification teams at double standard strength."

The response measures had begun. The cultivation world would meet this unprecedented threat with its full resources and determination. If the void practitioner sought entry to Azure Peaks territory, it would find not easy access but prepared resistance.

---

Wei Liang sensed the increased boundary patrols before seeing them—spiritual signatures moving in coordinated patterns along the border between the Wastes and Azure Peaks territory. His fractured consciousness extended perception beyond normal range, identifying cultivation techniques distinctive to the sect that had raised and ultimately betrayed him.

"They've received the White Lotus reports," he observed to the Hollow Woman, who flowed beside him through the corrupted landscape. "Their response is... substantial."

They had traveled northeast for three days since the encounter with the White Lotus hunters, moving steadily closer to Azure Peaks territory while avoiding direct confrontation with the increasing number of cultivators entering the Wastes' boundary regions. Wei Liang had used this time to refine his Fracture abilities further, practicing reality seam manipulation to bypass detection arrays, enhanced consumption to absorb ambient corruption energy rather than cultivator essence, and fragmented projection to scout paths without risking his primary form.

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly, her own perception extending toward the boundary. "Three-tiered response," she analyzed. "Boundary patrols with specialized purification teams. Investigation teams at our previous encounter site. Emergency array network for early warning."

Wei Liang nodded, impressed by her detailed assessment from limited spiritual impressions. Centuries of existence had clearly honed her perception beyond even his Fracture-enhanced senses.

"Standard sect response to significant corruption threat," he noted, recognizing the pattern from his years observing Azure Peaks operations. "Though the purification team strength suggests they recognize this threat as beyond standard classification."

They had reached a region where the Wastes' corruption manifested as temporal distortion—areas where time flowed at different rates relative to surrounding territory. These distortions appeared to Wei Liang's enhanced perception as rippling patterns in reality's fabric, places where existence itself stretched or compressed according to corruption's influence.

He selected their position carefully, finding a location where temporal flow matched normal rate while providing clear observation of the boundary region. From this vantage point, they could monitor Azure Peaks patrols without entering detection range of purification arrays.

"What is your next move?" the Hollow Woman asked, her darkness settling into observation formation beside him. "Direct confrontation would be unwise given their preparation level."

Wei Liang had been considering this question throughout their journey. Direct approach to the sect itself remained his ultimate objective, but intermediate steps would better serve his purpose—building anticipation, creating specific impressions, controlling the narrative that preceded his actual return.

"Not confrontation," he decided. "Information gathering. I need to understand exactly how they've responded to reports of my emergence—not just tactically but emotionally."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been curiosity. "Emotional responses from cultivators are difficult to assess from distance."

"Not from distance," Wei Liang clarified. "From infiltration."

This statement clearly surprised her, her darkness contracting suddenly. "You propose entering Azure Peaks territory in your current form? Their detection arrays would identify void corruption immediately."

"Not in my current form," he explained. "Through fragmented projection, modified to mask void signature."

Wei Liang had been developing this application of Fracture abilities during their journey—a specialized projection technique that created a fragment of his consciousness without the void signature that would trigger detection arrays. The projection would appear as ordinary spiritual energy rather than structured emptiness, allowing it to pass boundary defenses undetected.

The limitation, of course, was power—the projection could maintain only minimal abilities, could exist only temporarily before requiring reabsorption into his primary form. But for information gathering rather than confrontation, these limitations were acceptable.

"Interesting application," the Hollow Woman acknowledged after considering the technique. "Though risky. If the projection is discovered, they will implement countermeasures that complicate your eventual approach."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment without changing his decision. The risk was justified by potential information gain—understanding exactly how Azure Peaks leadership had interpreted reports of his emergence, what specific countermeasures they had prepared, whether Feng Zhao had recognized the possibility of his survival and transformation.

"I'll target peripheral locations first," he explained. "Small villages under sect protection rather than the mountain itself. Less detection, less risk, still valuable information about response patterns."

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly, suggesting acceptance of his approach. "When will you attempt this projection?"

"Tonight," Wei Liang decided. "When boundary patrols change rotation. The momentary gap in coverage will provide optimal crossing opportunity."

They settled into waiting position, Wei Liang using the intervening hours to prepare for the specialized projection technique. His fractured consciousness divided attention between external awareness and internal preparation—identifying which aspects of self could be projected without void signature, which abilities could be maintained without drawing on emptiness directly, which memories and knowledge would be necessary for effective information gathering.

The Hollow Woman maintained her own observation of the boundary region, occasionally reporting patrol movements or detection array adjustments. Her centuries of experience provided valuable context for Azure Peaks security protocols, identifying patterns and weaknesses that might have escaped even Wei Liang's intimate knowledge of the sect.

As twilight deepened toward night, the boundary patrols began their rotation change—cultivators who had maintained position for twelve hours being replaced by fresh teams with renewed spiritual energy. This transition created brief coverage gaps as teams moved between assigned sectors, gaps nearly imperceptible to conventional detection but clearly visible to Wei Liang's enhanced perception.

"Now," the Hollow Woman indicated as one such gap appeared in the northeastern quadrant.

Wei Liang initiated the specialized projection technique, his fractured consciousness identifying a fragment that could exist temporarily without direct connection to his void nature. With precise intent, he separated this fragment from his primary form, constructing a projection that resembled his original human appearance rather than his transformed state.

The projection formed at the edge of their observation position—a translucent figure that gradually solidified into seemingly human form. To conventional perception, it would appear as an ordinary cultivator with modest spiritual energy, nothing to trigger specialized detection arrays or attract particular attention.

Wei Liang maintained dual consciousness, his primary awareness remaining with his transformed body while a secondary awareness extended through the projection. This divided perception was disorienting at first, requiring careful focus to maintain coherent function in both forms simultaneously.

"Effective disguise," the Hollow Woman observed, studying the projection with her ancient perception. "Though limited duration, I suspect. The separation from void source will create increasing instability."

Wei Liang nodded through the projection, testing its responsiveness to his divided will. "Four hours at most," he estimated. "Sufficient for initial reconnaissance."

The projection moved toward the boundary, approaching the gap in patrol coverage with careful timing. Wei Liang's knowledge of Azure Peaks security protocols guided its movement, avoiding detection arrays while maintaining appearance of legitimate travel along established paths.

The boundary crossing itself proved simpler than anticipated—the projection passing from corrupted territory to purified land with only minimal resistance from protective formations. To detection arrays, it registered as returning cultivator rather than invading entity, its spiritual signature modified to suggest recent purification treatment following Wastes exposure.

Once across the boundary, the projection followed a path toward the nearest village under Azure Peaks protection—a small settlement named Stone Creek that served primarily as supply point for boundary patrols. Wei Liang had visited this village multiple times during his years as rootless disciple, accompanying supply missions or delivering messages between patrol stations.

The village appeared largely unchanged since his last visit—perhaps fifty modest buildings arranged around a central square, a small cultivation outpost at its eastern edge, farmland surrounding the settlement on three sides. Lights still burned in several buildings despite the late hour, suggesting activity beyond normal village routine.

Wei Liang directed the projection toward the village's only inn, a two-story structure facing the central square. This establishment served both traveling cultivators and merchants, making it ideal gathering point for information about recent events. The projection entered with the confident manner of a returning patrol cultivator, its appearance and spiritual signature designed to avoid particular notice.

The inn's common room contained perhaps twenty people—a mix of village residents, merchants, and junior cultivators assigned to nearby patrol stations. Conversations flowed freely, voices carrying clearly to the projection's enhanced hearing as Wei Liang guided it toward an empty table near the room's center.

"...third team sent to investigate just today," one patrol cultivator was saying to his companions. "Elder Shen herself reviewed their equipment loadout before departure."

"Waste of resources," another responded, his tone suggesting experienced cynicism. "White Lotus always exaggerates corruption threats. Probably just another mindless entity they failed to handle properly."

"This one's different," the first cultivator insisted. "My cousin serves in Elder Shen's communication corps. Says the reports describe something that can think, can plan. Not mindless at all."

Wei Liang absorbed these fragments of conversation with interest, directing the projection to order a simple meal to maintain its cover while continuing to monitor discussions throughout the room. The village residents seemed aware of increased sect activity but lacked specific information about its cause—their conversations focused on practical impacts rather than underlying threat.

The patrol cultivators, however, clearly had more detailed knowledge—their discussions revealing specific response measures beyond what Wei Liang had observed from outside the boundary. Specialized purification teams had been deployed not just along the border but at key locations throughout sect territory. Investigation teams were examining not only the White Lotus encounter site but all recent mission locations in the Wastes. Emergency evacuation protocols had been established for villages within fifty miles of the boundary.

Most interesting was a fragment of conversation between two senior patrol cultivators seated near the inn's hearth.

"...called Feng Zhao back from northern territories," one mentioned quietly. "Emergency recall, transportation talismans authorized."

"Why him specifically?" the other asked. "His team's mostly new disciples, barely past Foundation Establishment."

"Don't know details," the first admitted. "But it's connected to the void practitioner emergence. My section leader mentioned something about Feng Zhao's last Wastes expedition before all this started."

This confirmation that Azure Peaks leadership had made connection between his emergence and Feng Zhao's expedition suggested Elder Shen at least suspected his identity. The emergency recall indicated preparation for specific confrontation rather than general threat response—they wanted Feng Zhao present when the void practitioner eventually approached.

Wei Liang directed the projection to finish its meal and depart the inn, moving toward the cultivation outpost at the village's edge. This small compound housed temporary quarters for patrol cultivators, communication arrays for reporting to the sect, and basic purification facilities for those returning from boundary duty.

The projection maintained its cover as returning patrol member, approaching the outpost with appropriate deference to the guard at its gate. Wei Liang had calculated this approach carefully—the late hour meant minimal staffing, increasing chances of accessing information without detailed identity verification.

"Returning from eastern section," the projection informed the guard, its spiritual signature modified to match expected patrol patterns. "Need to access communication array for status update before rest period."

The guard—a young cultivator barely past Foundation Establishment—performed only cursory verification before allowing entry. The outpost's interior contained few cultivators at this hour, most either on duty at the boundary or resting in preparation for morning rotation.

Wei Liang guided the projection to the communication room, a small chamber containing arrays connected to the sect's information network. These arrays allowed patrol stations to access recent reports, update status logs, and receive new instructions without direct contact with mountain headquarters.

The projection activated a standard array, its spiritual signature accepted without special verification. Wei Liang directed it to access recent security bulletins, scanning quickly for information about void practitioner response measures. The bulletins confirmed what he had already gathered from conversations—increased patrols, specialized teams, investigation focus—while adding specific details about deployment locations and communication protocols.

Most valuable was a restricted bulletin addressed specifically to patrol leaders, describing the void practitioner's known capabilities and recommended countermeasures. The description was impressively accurate—Fracture stage abilities detailed with precision that suggested White Lotus hunters had provided comprehensive reports despite their brief encounter.

The recommended countermeasures, however, revealed fundamental misunderstanding of his transformed nature. They focused on severing connection between practitioner and void—techniques that would be effective against traditional void cultivators but useless against Wei Liang's integrated emptiness. They emphasized purification barriers that could contain corruption spread but couldn't affect his structured void directly.

Only one countermeasure showed genuine insight—a specialized technique developed by Elder Shen herself that targeted the structured patterns within void rather than the emptiness itself. This approach demonstrated understanding beyond conventional knowledge, suggesting she had studied the Forgotten Path more thoroughly than most cultivation leaders.

Wei Liang had the projection copy this bulletin to memory before deactivating the array and departing the communication room. The information gathered already justified the projection technique's risk, providing valuable insight into Azure Peaks' response patterns and tactical approach.

As the projection exited the outpost, Wei Liang sensed increasing instability in its structure—the separation from his void nature creating progressive deterioration that would eventually force reabsorption. He had perhaps an hour remaining before the projection would collapse, time enough to gather additional information from one more location before returning across the boundary.

He directed the projection toward the village's small market square, where even at this late hour, a few vendors maintained stalls serving patrol cultivators rotating between duty shifts. These vendors—many retired cultivators themselves—often possessed information not found in official channels, gathered through decades of observation and conversation with sect members at all levels.

The projection approached a tea stall operated by an elderly woman Wei Liang recognized from his previous visits to Stone Creek. Old Mei had served tea to Azure Peaks cultivators for nearly fifty years, her establishment a known gathering place for those seeking unofficial news and gossip about sect activities.

"Late night patrol?" she greeted the projection as it took seat at her simple counter. "You look like you could use something stronger than tea."

Wei Liang had the projection smile with appropriate weariness. "Tea is sufficient, Elder Mei. Though information would be more welcome than beverage."

She chuckled, preparing a pot with practiced efficiency. "Information is my specialty, young cultivator. What sort interests you this evening?"

"The void practitioner from the Wastes," the projection replied directly. "The one that has Elder Shen recalling disciples from northern territories."

Old Mei's hands paused briefly in their preparation before resuming. "Dangerous curiosity," she observed, her voice lowered despite the empty square. "Sect leadership prefers such matters remain within official channels."

"Which is precisely why unofficial channels become necessary," the projection countered. "Patrol cultivators face this threat directly. We deserve more than sanitized bulletins."

This approach—appealing to the divide between field cultivators and sect leadership—was calculated to resonate with Old Mei's known sympathies. She had spent decades serving those who implemented sect policies rather than those who created them, developing perspective that valued practical knowledge over official position.

She studied the projection carefully before responding, her aged eyes showing sharper assessment than her casual manner suggested. "They say it was once human," she finally offered, pouring tea with deliberate precision. "A disciple lost during a mission gone wrong. Transformed rather than killed by whatever they encountered."

Wei Liang maintained the projection's neutral expression despite this confirmation that his identity was at least suspected within the sect. "Which disciple?" he asked, keeping his tone merely curious rather than personally invested.

Old Mei shrugged slightly. "Names aren't shared in whispers. But they say Elder Shen has been reviewing mission records personally, focusing on expeditions led by inner disciple Feng Zhao."

"Why him specifically?" the projection asked, echoing the question from the earlier conversation between patrol cultivators.

"His last Wastes expedition lost a disciple," she replied. "Not significant enough for formal memorial—just a rootless one without cultivation potential. But timing matches when corruption began accelerating from that region."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest beyond what the projection displayed. His "death" had indeed been recorded as mission casualty rather than betrayal, his status as rootless disciple ensuring minimal investigation beyond Feng Zhao's official report. Yet Elder Shen had made connection between this seemingly minor loss and the void practitioner's emergence—suggesting either unusual insight or prior suspicion about the expedition's events.

"What else do the whispers say about this void practitioner?" the projection asked, sipping tea with apparent casualness.

Old Mei glanced around the empty square before leaning closer. "That it's coming specifically for Azure Peaks. Not random corruption spread but deliberate targeting. That it remembers who it was and why it changed. That Elder Shen has implemented contingencies beyond standard void containment protocols."

This last detail particularly interested Wei Liang. "What contingencies?"

"Personal involvement," Old Mei said simply. "She's preparing to confront this entity herself rather than delegating to purification teams. First time in decades she's taken direct field position for threat response."

Elder Shen's personal involvement suggested recognition beyond mere corruption threat—understanding that what approached required response from the sect's most powerful cultivator rather than standard teams. Whether this decision stemmed from tactical assessment or personal responsibility remained unclear, but its significance was undeniable.

The projection finished its tea as Wei Liang sensed increasing instability in its structure. The separation from his void nature had progressed further than anticipated, accelerating deterioration beyond sustainable levels. He needed to withdraw the projection immediately or risk uncontrolled collapse that might trigger detection arrays.

"Thank you for the tea and conversation, Elder Mei," the projection said, placing payment on the counter with appropriate courtesy. "Your insights are more valuable than official bulletins."

She nodded, accepting both payment and compliment with the dignity of one accustomed to serving as unofficial information nexus. "Be careful on your return patrol, young cultivator. The boundary grows more dangerous with each passing day."

The projection departed the tea stall, moving with deliberate casualness toward the village's edge while Wei Liang calculated optimal return route to minimize detection risk. The information gathered had exceeded expectations, providing valuable insight into Azure Peaks' response patterns, tactical approach, and—most significantly—recognition of personal connection between void practitioner and sect.

As the projection reached the village perimeter, Wei Liang sensed patrol movement along the boundary—rotation patterns shifting as midnight approached. This created another temporary coverage gap, offering opportunity for return crossing with minimal detection risk.

The projection moved quickly but not suspiciously toward this gap, maintaining appearance of legitimate travel while avoiding direct observation by village residents or patrol cultivators. Its deteriorating structure required increasing concentration to maintain, Wei Liang's divided consciousness struggling to prevent premature collapse before reaching safe reabsorption distance.

The boundary crossing proved more challenging than initial entry—the projection's unstable structure triggering minor alerts in purification arrays despite its modified spiritual signature. Wei Liang guided it through with precise timing, exploiting patrol movement patterns to avoid direct interception while navigating between detection zones.

Once back in corrupted territory, the projection moved directly toward Wei Liang's primary position, its structure deteriorating rapidly now that boundary crossing stress had accelerated instability. The Hollow Woman observed its approach with what might have been approval, her darkness expanding slightly to assist in masking its return from potential observers.

"Successful infiltration," she noted as the projection reached their position. "Though cutting return timing rather close."

Wei Liang didn't respond verbally, focusing instead on reabsorption process as the projection's structure began final collapse. With careful intent, he drew the fragment back into his primary consciousness, reintegrating the separated aspects of self while preserving information gathered during infiltration.

The reabsorption completed just as the projection would have collapsed independently, its structure dissolving as the fragment returned to Wei Liang's fractured consciousness. The experience of reintegration was disorienting—memories from the projection merging with his primary awareness, creating momentary confusion before his Fracture-stage consciousness reestablished proper organization.

"What did you learn?" the Hollow Woman asked once reintegration had completed.

Wei Liang processed the gathered information before responding, his fractured consciousness organizing details into coherent assessment. "They suspect my identity," he finally said. "Elder Shen has connected void practitioner emergence with Feng Zhao's expedition that 'lost' a rootless disciple."

"Expected," the Hollow Woman observed. "The timing correlation would be obvious to any experienced cultivator."

"More significant is their response pattern," Wei Liang continued. "Elder Shen has recalled Feng Zhao specifically, is preparing for personal involvement in confrontation, has developed specialized countermeasures targeting structured void rather than conventional corruption."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been concern. "Elder Shen's personal involvement changes tactical considerations significantly. Her cultivation base is formidable even by ancient standards."

Wei Liang nodded, having anticipated this complication. Elder Shen's centuries of cultivation experience made her dangerous opponent regardless of preparation—her understanding of fundamental principles allowing her to adapt techniques to unprecedented situations more effectively than younger cultivators with rigid training.

"Her involvement confirms my approach is working," he noted. "Recognition is already occurring at leadership level. The connection between their actions and my transformation has been established."

"Recognition without acceptance," the Hollow Woman cautioned. "They acknowledge connection but not responsibility. Their response remains elimination rather than reconciliation."

"As expected," Wei Liang acknowledged. "Acceptance was never realistic objective. Recognition alone serves my purpose—forcing them to confront the consequence of their actions, to acknowledge the direct line between betrayal and transformation."

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "What is your next move, given this information?"

Wei Liang considered their options, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of multiple strategic considerations simultaneously. The information gathered through projection confirmed Azure Peaks leadership understood what approached them—not mindless corruption but deliberate return, not random threat but specific consequence. This understanding would shape their response, would influence preparation and deployment patterns in ways he could potentially exploit.

"We continue northeast," he decided. "Not directly toward sect headquarters but circling their territory, approaching from unexpected direction. Each movement forces response, depletes resources, creates anticipation without immediate confrontation."

"Psychological warfare rather than direct assault," the Hollow Woman observed. "Eroding confidence and certainty before physical engagement."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting this characterization of his approach. The cultivation world operated on confidence—belief in established hierarchies, certainty about reality's fundamental principles, assurance that threats could be categorized and countered through known methods. His existence as structured void in human form challenged these certainties, created cognitive dissonance that undermined response effectiveness regardless of cultivation base or technique mastery.

"We'll depart at dawn," he determined. "Moving north initially before curving east, approaching their mountain from direction opposite their expectations."

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly in what might have been approval. "Indirect approach suits your current capabilities. Direct confrontation with Elder Shen would be premature at Fracture stage."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment without comment. His transformation had progressed rapidly, his mastery of Fracture abilities developing beyond normal expectations, but Elder Shen represented centuries of cultivation refinement—power accumulated and perfected through consistent application rather than sudden transformation. Confronting her directly would require further progression, greater understanding of his evolved capabilities, more complete integration of consumed energy.

They settled into recovery positions, Wei Liang using remaining night hours to process information gathered through projection while refining his strategic approach. The Hollow Woman maintained perimeter awareness, her ancient perception monitoring boundary patrols and detection arrays for any indication their position had been compromised.

As dawn approached—the Wastes' perpetual twilight shifting toward its lighter phase—Wei Liang completed his assessment and refinement. The infiltration had provided valuable tactical information while confirming his broader approach was achieving desired effect. Azure Peaks leadership recognized what approached them—not mindless corruption but deliberate return, not random threat but specific consequence.

The cultivation world had discarded the rootless disciple as worthless; they would soon confront the consequence of that judgment in form they could neither ignore nor forget. Wei Liang would ensure recognition became unavoidable, would force acknowledgment of connection between their betrayal and his transformation. Not for reconciliation, which was impossible. Not for forgiveness, which was irrelevant. But for consequence—the natural result of actions taken without consideration of potential outcomes.

The Forgotten Path unfolded before him, and Wei Liang walked it with deliberate intent—each step bringing him closer to the reckoning he had promised, the return they had never anticipated, the recognition they could no longer deny.
# Chapter 2: The Expedition

Dawn broke over the Azure Peaks Sect with a thin, gray light that promised rain. Wei Liang stood in the expedition preparation hall, a cavernous space normally reserved for inner disciples before important missions. He had arrived before anyone else, positioning himself near the back wall where he might go unnoticed until needed. His few possessions were bundled in a small pack at his feet—an extra set of robes, a wooden cup, a thin blanket, and the dried rations allocated to support staff.

The hall gradually filled with disciples of various ranks, their voices echoing off the stone walls. Most were outer disciples like Wei Liang, though their gray robes were newer, their postures more confident. They clustered in small groups, excitement and apprehension mingling in their conversations. An expedition to the Shattered Wastes carried prestige even for those in supporting roles—assuming they returned.

"...heard there's a formation array from before the divine war..."

"...Elder Shen wouldn't authorize this without good reason..."

"...chance to prove ourselves to the inner disciples..."

Wei Liang absorbed their words without changing his expression. Formation arrays from the era of the forgotten gods were dangerous beyond measure—powerful enough to reshape reality but often corrupted by the cataclysm that created the Wastes. Whatever Feng Zhao sought there, it wasn't mere spiritual resources.

The hall fell silent as the inner disciples arrived, led by Feng Zhao himself. He wore combat robes rather than the formal sect attire, with protective talismans sewn into the fabric and a wooden sword sheathed at his waist. Behind him came five other inner disciples, all at least at the late stages of Foundation Establishment, their expressions serious and focused.

Feng Zhao surveyed the assembled disciples, his gaze passing over Wei Liang without acknowledgment. "The expedition to the Shattered Wastes begins today. Our objective is to locate and retrieve a specific artifact from the eastern quadrant. You've all been selected for your particular skills."

Wei Liang kept his face carefully neutral. His "particular skill" was his expendability, nothing more.

"The journey will take three days to reach the Wastes' periphery," Feng Zhao continued. "Once there, we'll establish a base camp. Inner disciples will form the exploration team, while outer disciples will maintain the camp and secure our retreat path. This is not a training exercise. The Wastes are hostile territory where reality itself is unstable. Follow instructions precisely or risk being left behind."

The threat hung in the air, all the more effective for its matter-of-fact delivery. Wei Liang noticed several outer disciples shifting uncomfortably.

"Equipment distribution will begin immediately. We depart in one hour. Dismissed."

As the disciples moved toward the supply tables, Wei Liang remained in place, waiting until the initial rush subsided. He knew his role would be determined last, after all meaningful positions were assigned. When he finally approached the distribution area, only the heaviest packs remained—tents, cooking equipment, and other burdens deemed too menial for disciples with actual cultivation potential.

"Wei Liang." The supply master checked a list. "You're assigned to general portage and camp maintenance. Take packs seven and twelve."

Wei Liang nodded and lifted the designated packs. Their weight was substantial, designed for disciples who could reinforce their bodies with spiritual energy. For someone without cultivation, they would be punishing over long distances. He adjusted the straps across his shoulders, distributing the weight as evenly as possible.

As he turned to leave, he noticed Liu Mei at another table, carefully packing medicinal herbs into a specialized container. Their eyes met briefly. She gave him a small nod—not friendly exactly, but acknowledging his existence, which was more than most bothered with. Wei Liang returned the gesture before making his way outside.

The expedition assembled in the sect's main courtyard under a sky heavy with unshed rain. Twenty disciples in total—six inner and fourteen outer—arranged in formation with Feng Zhao at the lead. Wei Liang took his place at the rear, where the weakest and least important traditionally stood. From this position, he could observe everyone while remaining largely unnoticed.

A small crowd had gathered to see them off, mostly other disciples and a few elders. Wei Liang scanned the onlookers, surprised to find Yun Hua among them. She stood slightly apart from the others, her expression thoughtful. When her gaze met his, she made a subtle gesture with her hand—a water element sign for caution. Wei Liang blinked in acknowledgment, careful not to show any other reaction.

Feng Zhao raised his hand, and the expedition began to move. They passed through the sect gates and onto the mountain path that would take them down to the valley below. No one spoke. The only sounds were footsteps on stone and the distant rumble of thunder.

Wei Liang focused on his breathing as they descended, using techniques he had read about to manage the strain of the heavy packs. Each step sent jolts of pain through his shoulders and back, but he kept pace, knowing that falling behind would only draw unwanted attention.

The rain began as they reached the valley floor, a gentle shower that quickly intensified into a downpour. The inner disciples activated water-repelling talismans, creating invisible barriers that kept them dry. The outer disciples had simpler protective charms that merely prevented their robes from becoming sodden. Wei Liang had nothing, and within minutes he was drenched, his robes clinging to his skin, water running in rivulets down his face.

They continued through the rain for hours, following a trade road that wound through forests and fields. Occasionally they passed small villages where farmers paused in their work to watch the sect disciples march by. Wei Liang noted how the villagers bowed their heads respectfully as the inner disciples passed, then returned to their tasks without waiting for the rear of the formation. To them, he and the other support staff were invisible—an appropriate metaphor for his entire existence.

By midday, the rain had stopped, but the damage was done. Wei Liang's soaked robes chafed against his skin, and his sodden shoes had begun to blister his feet. The weight of the packs seemed to increase with each mile, the straps digging into his shoulders like dull knives. He maintained his pace through sheer determination, focusing on the rhythm of his breathing and the placement of each foot.

When Feng Zhao finally called for a rest, Wei Liang carefully lowered his packs to the ground, keeping his face impassive despite the relief that flooded his muscles. They had stopped beside a small stream, the water clear and swift after the rain. The inner disciples gathered upstream, while the outer disciples spread out along the banks.

Wei Liang found a spot downstream from everyone else and knelt by the water. He cupped his hands and drank deeply, the cold water soothing his parched throat. As he straightened, he caught sight of his reflection in the stream—a pale face with hollow cheeks, dark circles under watchful eyes, hair plastered to his skull by the earlier rain. He looked exactly what he was: a burden-bearer, a tool to be used and discarded.

"You should dry your robes while you can."

Wei Liang turned to find Liu Mei standing nearby, her expression neutral but not unkind. Unlike him, she appeared relatively unaffected by the journey, her movements easy and controlled.

"The next stretch has no shelter," she continued when he didn't respond. "Wet clothing in mountain air leads to sickness."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. "Thank you for the advice."

He had spoken to Liu Mei perhaps a dozen times in the three years since his elevation to outer disciple. She worked in the sect's medicine hall, specializing in herb cultivation rather than combat techniques. They had occasionally crossed paths when he was assigned to clean the greenhouses or deliver supplies. She had never been cruel to him, which in the context of the sect made her practically benevolent.

Liu Mei glanced at the heavy packs beside him. "Those are meant for disciples who can channel spiritual energy for reinforcement."

"I manage," Wei Liang said simply.

She studied him for a moment, her practical nature evident in her assessing gaze. "There are pressure points that can temporarily reduce pain. They're not a substitute for cultivation, but they might help."

Before Wei Liang could respond, a sharp voice cut through the air.

"Liu Mei! Are you consulting with our rootless disciple about cultivation techniques? How ambitious of him."

Feng Zhao approached from upstream, his expression one of amused disdain. Two other inner disciples flanked him, watching the exchange with interest.

Liu Mei bowed respectfully. "Senior Brother Feng, I was discussing medicinal matters only. Preventing sickness among the support staff will ensure the expedition's efficiency."

Her practical framing of the interaction was clever, Wei Liang noted. She had presented her assistance not as kindness but as expedition management—something Feng Zhao could hardly object to without seeming petty.

Feng Zhao's smile didn't reach his eyes. "How conscientious. But don't waste too much time. Some vessels are simply too flawed to hold water, no matter how carefully you tend them."

The metaphor was deliberate—a water element saying twisted into an insult. Wei Liang kept his gaze lowered, his face expressionless.

"We resume in ten minutes," Feng Zhao announced, loud enough for all to hear. "Anyone not ready will be left to catch up on their own."

He walked away, his companions following. Liu Mei waited until they were out of earshot before speaking again, her voice low.

"The pressure points are here and here." She touched her own shoulder briefly, indicating locations. "Press firmly for ten breaths when the pain becomes too much."

Wei Liang committed the positions to memory. "Thank you."

Liu Mei nodded once, then returned to her own preparations. Wei Liang quickly wrung out his robes as best he could and used the brief remaining time to massage the pressure points she had shown him. The relief was minor but noticeable—enough to make the difference between endurance and collapse in the miles ahead.

When Feng Zhao called for the expedition to continue, Wei Liang shouldered his packs with renewed determination. The path now led upward, leaving the valley and climbing into the foothills that separated the sect's territory from the wilderness beyond. The terrain grew increasingly rugged, with narrow trails winding between rocky outcroppings and sparse, wind-twisted trees.

By evening, they had reached a plateau where Feng Zhao ordered camp to be established. Wei Liang worked silently alongside the other outer disciples, erecting tents, gathering firewood, and preparing the evening meal. His body ached from the day's journey, but he moved with practiced efficiency, completing each task without complaint.

The camp formed a rough circle, with the inner disciples' tents at the center and the outer disciples arranged around the periphery. Wei Liang was assigned the furthest position from the center—the least protected spot should danger approach during the night. He set up his small tent with methodical precision, then reported for his night watch assignment.

"Third watch," the duty roster keeper told him without looking up. "Northwest perimeter."

The third watch was the most difficult—the deepest part of night when the body craved sleep most desperately. The northwest perimeter faced away from the direction they had come, toward the distant Wastes. Wei Liang accepted the assignment with a bow and returned to his tent.

He ate his portion of the evening meal alone, a simple bowl of rice and preserved vegetables. Around him, the other disciples gathered in small groups, sharing food and conversation. The inner disciples sat apart, their voices carrying as they discussed the days ahead.

"The target location is approximately two days into the eastern quadrant," Feng Zhao was saying. "According to Elder Shen's information, the formation array remains partially intact despite the reality distortions."

"What exactly are we retrieving?" asked one of the other inner disciples.

"A control node from the array. Elder Shen believes it contains cultivation insights from before the divine war."

Wei Liang kept his head down, but his ears caught every word. A control node from an ancient formation array would be incredibly valuable—and incredibly dangerous. Such artifacts were often corrupted by the cataclysm that created the Wastes, their functions twisted in unpredictable ways.

As darkness fell, the camp grew quiet. Wei Liang retreated to his tent but did not sleep. Instead, he sat cross-legged on his thin bedroll and began the breathing exercises that had become his nightly ritual. Though he could not cultivate in the traditional sense, the techniques still helped prepare his body for the challenges ahead.

He focused on each breath, imagining spiritual energy flowing through the meridians he had memorized from forbidden texts. In his mind, he traced the paths that spiritual energy should follow, envisioning the circulation that would strengthen his body and refine his spirit—if only he had a spirit root to gather that energy.

Time passed in measured breaths until it was his turn for watch duty. Wei Liang emerged from his tent into the cold night air. The sky had cleared after the day's rain, revealing a vast expanse of stars overhead. He made his way to the northwest perimeter and took up his position, scanning the darkness beyond the camp's boundary.

The night was alive with small sounds—the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze, the distant call of night birds, the soft breathing of sleeping disciples. Wei Liang stood motionless, his senses alert for anything unusual. This far from the sect, wild beasts were a concern, though the greater dangers would come when they reached the Wastes themselves.

As the hours of his watch passed, Wei Liang's thoughts turned to what lay ahead. The Shattered Wastes were not merely dangerous territory—they were a wound in reality itself, a place where the laws of nature had been broken during the war of the forgotten gods. Few ventured there willingly, and those who did often returned changed, if they returned at all.

He had read every account of the Wastes available in the sect library, committing the descriptions to memory. Reality fissures that could transport a person miles in an instant. Zones where time flowed differently, where minutes might pass as hours or years as moments. Corrupted spiritual energy that could twist cultivation techniques back upon their users. Strange entities that defied classification, neither beast nor spirit but something in between.

And yet, for all its dangers, the Wastes held a strange allure for Wei Liang. In a place where reality itself was broken, perhaps the rules that defined his existence—that deemed him worthless for lack of a spirit root—might also break. It was a foolish thought, born of desperation rather than reason, but it lingered nonetheless.

Movement at the edge of his vision snapped Wei Liang back to alertness. He turned slowly, careful not to make any sudden motions that might provoke a response. At first, he saw nothing but shadows among the rocks that dotted the plateau's edge. Then a deeper darkness moved—something large and silent, watching the camp from just beyond the perimeter.

Wei Liang remained still, weighing his options. Protocol required alerting the camp to potential threats, but doing so without confirmation would earn him mockery at best, punishment at worst. He needed to identify the intruder first.

Slowly, he reached for a small stone at his feet. With a precise flick of his wrist, he sent it arcing toward the darkness where he had seen movement. The stone clattered against rock, and the shadow moved—not away, as a startled animal might, but toward the sound, with deliberate purpose.

In the faint starlight, Wei Liang caught a glimpse of the intruder—a creature like a mountain cat but larger, with too many limbs arranged in unsettling asymmetry. Its eyes reflected the distant campfire with an unnatural purple glow. A Waste-touched beast, corrupted by proximity to the shattered reality beyond the mountains.

Wei Liang backed toward the camp, keeping his movements slow and his eyes on the creature. When he judged himself close enough to be heard without shouting, he spoke in a clear, controlled voice.

"Waste-touched beast at the northwest perimeter. Approximately thirty paces out."

The camp erupted into activity. Inner disciples emerged from their tents, spiritual energy already gathering around their hands. Outer disciples scrambled for weapons or defensive positions according to their assigned roles. Wei Liang held his ground, continuing to watch the creature as it assessed the suddenly alert camp.

Feng Zhao strode forward, his wooden sword now unsheathed and glowing with green spiritual energy. "Where?"

Wei Liang pointed. "Among the rocks. Felid form, multiple limbs, purple eye-shine."

Feng Zhao narrowed his eyes, scanning the darkness. The creature chose that moment to move, slinking between two boulders with unnatural fluidity. Feng Zhao raised his sword, wood element energy coalescing around the blade.

"Verdant Binding," he intoned, slashing the sword in a precise pattern.

Tendrils of green energy shot from the blade, crossing the distance to the creature in an instant. They wrapped around the beast, immobilizing it mid-stride. It thrashed against the bindings, a sound like grinding stone emerging from its throat.

Two other inner disciples moved to flank Feng Zhao, their own techniques ready. One wielded fire element energy that formed a blazing spear in his hand, while the other manipulated metal element energy into floating needles that orbited his body.

"Waste-touched beasts often travel in groups," Feng Zhao said, his eyes never leaving the captured creature. "Secure the perimeter. Search in pairs."

The disciples spread out, checking the camp's boundaries for additional threats. Wei Liang remained at his post, watching the captured beast as it struggled against Feng Zhao's technique. Its movements were becoming more erratic, its form seeming to shift and blur at the edges.

"Senior Brother Feng," Wei Liang said quietly, "the creature's form is destabilizing."

Feng Zhao glanced at him with irritation, then back at the beast. His eyes widened slightly as he observed the same phenomenon—the creature's outline wavering like heat distortion, its limbs occasionally seeming to pass through the energy bindings rather than being constrained by them.

"Reality fluctuation," Feng Zhao muttered. "We're closer to the Wastes' influence than I thought."

He made a sharp gesture with his sword, and the green energy bindings constricted violently. The creature emitted a sound like shattering glass, then collapsed into itself, its form dissolving into motes of purple light that scattered on the night breeze.

Wei Liang watched the dissolution with a mixture of fascination and dread. The beast hadn't died in any conventional sense—it had unraveled, its corrupted existence unable to maintain coherence once its connection to the Wastes was severed.

"No other threats detected," reported one of the returning inner disciples.

Feng Zhao nodded, sheathing his sword. "Double the watch for the remainder of the night. We'll reach the Wastes' periphery by tomorrow evening—earlier than expected if their influence has already spread this far."

His gaze fell on Wei Liang. "You spotted it first."

It wasn't a question or a compliment, merely an observation. Wei Liang inclined his head slightly, acknowledging without speaking.

"Return to your post," Feng Zhao said after a moment. "Report any further anomalies immediately."

Wei Liang bowed and returned to the northwest perimeter. The encounter had changed something subtle in the expedition's dynamics. He had performed his duty effectively, demonstrating value beyond mere burden-bearing. It wouldn't last—such moments never did—but for now, he existed in the rare space between invisibility and targeting.

The remainder of his watch passed without incident, and when his replacement arrived, Wei Liang returned to his tent. Sleep came in fitful bursts, his dreams filled with creatures that unraveled at the edges and purple light that whispered in voices just beyond comprehension.

Morning arrived with a blood-red sunrise that painted the mountains in ominous hues. The camp stirred to life, disciples preparing for the day's journey with greater urgency after the night's encounter. Wei Liang packed his few possessions and dismantled his tent with practiced efficiency, then reported for assignment.

"You'll take point today," the expedition coordinator told him, to Wei Liang's carefully concealed surprise. "Thirty paces ahead of the main group. Watch for signs of Waste-touched corruption and report back immediately if you spot anything unusual."

Point position was dangerous—the first to encounter threats, with the least support. It was also, Wei Liang recognized, a test. His performance during the night watch had earned him this opportunity to prove his worth—or to serve as the first casualty if they encountered more serious dangers.

He accepted the assignment with a bow and moved to the front of the forming expedition. As he waited for the signal to begin, Liu Mei approached, carrying a small cloth packet.

"Medicinal paste," she said, handing it to him. "For your shoulders and feet. Apply it during rest periods."

Wei Liang accepted the packet with genuine gratitude. "Thank you."

Liu Mei glanced toward the inner disciples, then back to Wei Liang. "Point position after spotting the Waste-touched beast. Interesting."

"A test," Wei Liang replied quietly.

She nodded. "Or expendability dressed as opportunity."

Before he could respond, Feng Zhao gave the signal to move out. Wei Liang secured the medicinal packet in his robes and started forward, maintaining the prescribed thirty-pace distance ahead of the main group.

The day's path led them higher into the mountains, following ancient trails that wound between towering peaks. The air grew thinner, each breath providing less satisfaction than the last. For the cultivators behind him, this posed little challenge—they could supplement their breathing with spiritual energy. For Wei Liang, it meant carefully managing his exertion, finding the balance between maintaining pace and conserving strength.

As they climbed, the landscape began to change in subtle ways. The vegetation grew sparser but stranger—plants with leaves that turned to follow sounds rather than sunlight, flowers that closed when approached, trees whose bark spiraled in mathematically impossible patterns. The wildlife, too, became increasingly unusual. Birds with too many wings circled overhead, while insects with geometrically perfect patterns crawled across stones that occasionally shifted position when no one was looking directly at them.

Wei Liang cataloged each anomaly, reporting back at regular intervals. The boundary between normal reality and the Wastes' influence was not a clear line but a gradual transition, with corruption becoming more pronounced the further they traveled. By midday, there was no doubt they had entered the periphery of the Shattered Wastes.

They stopped to rest beside a stream that flowed uphill in defiance of gravity. The water itself seemed normal when collected in cups or waterskins, but returned to its impossible course when poured back. The inner disciples examined the phenomenon with academic interest, while most of the outer disciples kept their distance, discomforted by the blatant violation of natural law.

Wei Liang used the break to apply Liu Mei's medicinal paste to his shoulders and feet. The effect was immediate—a cooling sensation that penetrated deep into his abused muscles, numbing pain and reducing inflammation. He recognized the scent of several rare herbs, combined in proportions that suggested significant skill. Such medicine would normally never be wasted on someone like him.

As he finished, he noticed Feng Zhao watching him from across the stream. The inner disciple's expression was unreadable, but his attention was deliberate, assessing. Wei Liang met his gaze for a brief moment before lowering his eyes, the proper response for an outer disciple. When he looked up again, Feng Zhao had turned away, deep in conversation with the other inner disciples.

The expedition resumed with Wei Liang again taking point. The trail now led through a narrow pass between two peaks that didn't quite match—one composed of dark granite, the other of pale limestone, their geological impossibility another sign of the Wastes' influence. As he entered the pass, Wei Liang felt a subtle pressure against his skin, as if the air itself had thickened.

He paused, raising his hand in the signal for caution. The expedition halted behind him as Feng Zhao moved forward to investigate.

"What is it?" he asked, his hand resting on his sword hilt.

"The air density changed," Wei Liang replied. "And there's a sound at the edge of hearing. Like whispers."

Feng Zhao frowned, extending his spiritual sense forward. After a moment, his expression sharpened with interest. "A reality fissure. Minor, but active."

He turned and gestured to the other inner disciples. "Formation positions. We'll pass through in controlled sequence."

The inner disciples arranged themselves in a hexagonal pattern, with outer disciples grouped in the center. Wei Liang found himself positioned near Feng Zhao, who began tracing complex patterns in the air with spiritual energy. The other inner disciples followed suit, creating a protective formation that surrounded the entire expedition.

"The fissure extends through the entire pass," Feng Zhao explained as he worked. "We'll move through together. Stay within the formation boundaries. Any separation could result in displacement to unknown locations within the Wastes."

When the formation was complete, they began moving forward as a single unit. As they entered the pass proper, the whispers Wei Liang had detected grew louder, resolving into overlapping voices speaking words that almost made sense. The air shimmered like heat distortion, occasionally revealing glimpses of other places—a vast plain of shattered glass, a forest of trees with mirrored leaves, a city whose architecture defied perspective.

Wei Liang kept his focus on the path ahead, ignoring the voices that seemed to call his name with increasing urgency. The pressure against his skin intensified, as if reality itself resisted their passage. Around him, the other disciples showed signs of strain—beads of sweat on their foreheads, tightened grips on weapons or talismans, quickened breathing.

Halfway through the pass, the fissure's effects intensified dramatically. The glimpses of other places became more frequent and substantial, sometimes overlapping with their current reality. Wei Liang's vision blurred as his mind struggled to reconcile the contradictory input. He stumbled, momentarily disoriented.

A hand gripped his arm, steadying him. To his surprise, it was Feng Zhao, his expression tense with concentration as he maintained the formation while keeping Wei Liang from straying beyond its boundaries.

"Focus on my voice," Feng Zhao commanded. "Count your steps. One through ten, then repeat."

Wei Liang obeyed, using the simple mental exercise to anchor himself against the fissure's disorienting effects. "One, two, three..."

They continued through the pass, each step requiring deliberate effort. The whispers grew to a cacophony, then abruptly ceased as they reached the far side. The pressure vanished, and reality snapped back into focus—still corrupted by the Wastes' influence, but stable in its corruption.

Feng Zhao released Wei Liang's arm and dissolved the formation with a gesture. "Everyone present?"

A quick count confirmed that the entire expedition had made it through intact. Several disciples looked shaken, and one outer disciple was vomiting at the side of the path, his body rejecting the experience of passing through the fissure.

"That was a minor fissure," Feng Zhao said, his voice carrying to all. "The deeper we go, the more severe they become. Remember your training. Focus on concrete details—counting, physical sensations, memorized texts. These can anchor you when reality becomes fluid."

Wei Liang noted the advice, adding it to his mental catalog of survival techniques. He had no formal training to fall back on, but he had his own methods—the breathing exercises, the memorized meridian paths, the cultivation theories he had studied in secret. Perhaps these would serve a similar purpose.

They continued onward, the landscape growing increasingly alien with each mile. Trees twisted into impossible knots, their branches occasionally reaching out to grasp at passing disciples. Rocks floated at eye level, rotating slowly around invisible axes. In one clearing, they found a perfect circle of flowers that aged from bud to bloom to decay and back again in endless cycles that took mere minutes to complete.

By late afternoon, they reached their destination for the day—a relatively stable plateau overlooking a valley that shimmered with distortion. Feng Zhao ordered camp established, with additional protective formations around the perimeter.

"We've reached the true boundary of the Shattered Wastes," he announced as the camp took shape. "Beyond that valley lies the eastern quadrant and our objective. We'll rest here tonight and enter at first light."

Wei Liang helped establish the camp, erecting tents and gathering what passed for firewood in this corrupted landscape—branches that remained warm to the touch long after being cut and occasionally hummed with discordant notes when stacked together. As he worked, he observed the valley below, noting how the distortions formed patterns that shifted and flowed like currents in water.

The Shattered Wastes proper. Tomorrow they would enter one of the most dangerous places in the world, seeking an artifact of immense power and unknown corruption. Wei Liang had no illusions about his role in what was to come. When danger threatened, the expendable would be expended. His only advantage was that everyone, including Feng Zhao, underestimated him—a lifetime of being overlooked had taught him to move unnoticed, to observe without being observed, to survive in the margins.

As night fell, the Wastes revealed new wonders and horrors. The sky above the valley rippled with auroras in colors that had no names, while the darkness between stars seemed to deepen until it formed shapes that moved with purpose. Strange calls echoed from the valley, some beautiful enough to draw tears, others so discordant they set teeth on edge.

Wei Liang took his assigned watch at the eastern perimeter, facing the valley that awaited them. As he stood his vigil, he felt something he had rarely experienced before—anticipation. Beyond that shimmering barrier of broken reality lay the unknown, yes, but also possibility. In a place where the laws of nature had shattered, perhaps the laws that had defined his life might also break.

The thought was dangerous, a seed of hope in soil that had long been salted with disappointment. Yet as he watched the impossible auroras paint the night with their nameless colors, Wei Liang allowed the seed to take root.

Tomorrow, they would enter the Shattered Wastes. Tomorrow, everything might change.



# Chapter 3: The Betrayal

Morning in the Shattered Wastes arrived with unsettling beauty. The sun rose not from the horizon but from the center of the sky, its light fragmenting through reality distortions into prismatic beams that painted the landscape in impossible colors. Wei Liang watched the phenomenon from the edge of camp, having finished his pre-dawn duties while most of the expedition still slept.

The valley below was now clearly visible in the strange morning light. What had appeared as shimmering distortion the previous evening revealed itself as a fractured landscape—islands of earth floating at various heights, rivers that flowed in loops and spirals defying gravity, forests where each tree existed in a different season. And cutting through it all, reality fissures that appeared as jagged tears in the air itself, edges glowing with energies that hurt the eyes if observed too directly.

"Magnificent, isn't it?" 

Wei Liang turned to find one of the inner disciples standing nearby—Disciple Chen, the youngest of the inner circle and the only one who had occasionally acknowledged Wei Liang's existence without contempt. His expression now was one of scholarly fascination as he surveyed the valley.

"And terrible," Wei Liang replied quietly.

Chen glanced at him with mild surprise, perhaps not expecting a philosophical observation from a rootless disciple. "Yes. Beauty and horror intertwined. The texts say the Wastes reflect the conflict that created them—divine powers both creative and destructive unleashed without restraint."

Wei Liang nodded slightly. He had read the same texts, though he wasn't supposed to have access to them. The divine war had been a cataclysm beyond mortal comprehension, fought with weapons that targeted reality itself. The forgotten gods had fallen or transcended, but their battlefield remained—a wound in the world that refused to heal.

"We enter within the hour," Chen said after a moment. "Senior Brother Feng has identified a path to the target location that should minimize exposure to major fissures."

"Should," Wei Liang repeated, the word carrying the weight of its uncertainty.

Chen's mouth quirked in what might have been the ghost of a smile. "Indeed. The Wastes are nothing if not unpredictable." He turned to leave, then paused. "Stay alert today, Wei Liang. The deeper we go, the more dangerous the journey becomes—for all of us."

The warning—or was it advice?—was unexpected. Wei Liang inclined his head in acknowledgment, and Chen returned to the center of camp where the inner disciples were gathering.

The expedition prepared with methodical efficiency, breaking down the camp and organizing equipment for the descent into the valley. Wei Liang was assigned to carry additional protective talismans and emergency supplies—items that would be needed if things went wrong, making him simultaneously burden-bearer and safeguard.

Feng Zhao addressed the group before they departed, his expression severe. "We enter the true Wastes now. Reality here is unstable and hostile. Maintain formation at all times. Outer disciples will establish a base camp at the first stable location we find. Inner disciples will continue to the target site. Expected return is before nightfall."

His gaze swept over the assembled disciples, lingering briefly on Wei Liang. "Any sign of corruption or instability in any expedition member is to be reported immediately. The Wastes affect minds as well as bodies. Confusion, memory lapses, or unusual behavior could indicate corruption."

The implication was clear—they would leave behind anyone who became a liability. Wei Liang absorbed this information without changing his expression. It was nothing more than he had expected.

They descended into the valley along a narrow path that wound between reality distortions. Feng Zhao led, using a specialized compass that detected stability rather than direction. Wei Liang was positioned in the middle of the formation this time, surrounded by other outer disciples—not out of concern for his safety, he knew, but to ensure the emergency supplies he carried remained accessible.

The air changed as they entered the valley proper, becoming thicker and somehow textured, as if each breath had to be pulled through layers of invisible resistance. Sounds behaved strangely, sometimes reaching the ear long after their source had moved on, other times arriving before the event that caused them. Wei Liang found himself hearing footsteps before they fell, voices before lips moved.

He focused on his breathing, using the techniques he had practiced for years to center himself. The Wastes might distort external reality, but his internal discipline remained a constant he could rely on.

The path led them through a forest of crystalline trees that chimed softly when the wind blew, each note sustaining longer than natural acoustics should allow. The ground beneath their feet occasionally rippled like water, though it remained solid enough to walk on. Overhead, birds with geometrically perfect plumage flew in formations that seemed to leave afterimages in the air.

They encountered their first major obstacle at a river that flowed in a vertical loop, water rushing upward against gravity before curving and falling back to the ground in a perpetual cycle. The only crossing point was a bridge of stone that phased in and out of existence at irregular intervals.

Feng Zhao studied the pattern for several minutes before turning to the expedition. "We'll cross in pairs, timing the bridge's manifestation. Inner disciples first to secure the far side, then outer disciples with essential supplies."

The crossing proceeded as ordered, disciples waiting for Feng Zhao's signal before sprinting across the temporarily solid bridge. Wei Liang watched carefully, noting how the bridge's manifestation cycle was gradually shortening—a detail he suspected Feng Zhao had also observed, explaining the increasing urgency of his commands.

When Wei Liang's turn came, the bridge was visible for barely five seconds at a time. He waited for Feng Zhao's signal, then ran, his feet pounding against stone that felt increasingly insubstantial with each step. The bridge began to fade as he reached the halfway point, edges dissolving into mist.

Wei Liang pushed himself harder, lungs burning as he sprinted the final distance. The stone beneath his final step had already half-vanished, providing minimal purchase. He leapt the last few feet, landing heavily on the far bank as the bridge disappeared completely behind him.

"Cutting it close, rootless," Feng Zhao remarked, his tone suggesting he wouldn't have been particularly troubled if Wei Liang had fallen.

Wei Liang straightened, adjusting the packs he carried. "This disciple apologizes for the delay."

Feng Zhao's eyes narrowed slightly at the formal response, perhaps searching for hidden insolence. Finding none in Wei Liang's carefully neutral expression, he turned away to oversee the remaining crossings.

They continued deeper into the Wastes, the corruption of reality growing more pronounced with each mile. Gravity became inconsistent—stronger in some places, weaker in others. Light bent around objects in impossible ways, creating shadows that moved independently of their sources. The very ground seemed uncertain of its nature, sometimes hard as stone, other times yielding like moss regardless of its appearance.

By midday, they reached a relatively stable area where Feng Zhao ordered the base camp established. It was a circular clearing surrounded by twisted trees whose branches grew inward rather than outward, creating a natural barrier. The ground here maintained consistent properties, and the air was clearer than in the surrounding areas.

"Outer disciples will remain here and establish defensive formations," Feng Zhao announced. "Inner disciples will continue to the target location, approximately two hours from this position."

He designated one of the senior outer disciples as camp leader, then selected three others to accompany the inner disciples as porters. To Wei Liang's carefully concealed surprise, he was among those chosen.

"You'll carry the containment vessel," Feng Zhao told him, indicating an ornate box crafted from multiple materials—wood, metal, water crystal, and stone segments fitted together in complex patterns. "It's designed to safely transport the artifact. Do not open it under any circumstances."

Wei Liang accepted the vessel with a bow, securing it in a specialized harness that distributed its considerable weight across his shoulders and back. The construction was fascinating—each material segment positioned to balance and contain different energy types, with formation arrays carved into the surfaces in script so ancient he could only recognize fragments.

As the inner disciples prepared to depart, Liu Mei approached Wei Liang, ostensibly checking the supplies he carried. Under the pretense of adjusting a strap, she spoke quietly.

"The vessel you're carrying—it's designed for corrupted artifacts. Be careful. If the artifact is activated, the vessel will seal automatically, trapping anything in contact with it."

Wei Liang gave a nearly imperceptible nod to indicate he understood. "Thank you."

Liu Mei stepped back, her expression professionally neutral once more. "The medicinal paste should last through today. Apply again if you feel strain returning."

She returned to her assigned duties, leaving Wei Liang to contemplate her warning. The containment vessel was both protection and potential trap—useful information that Feng Zhao had not bothered to share with the expendable porter assigned to carry it.

The reduced expedition departed the base camp, following a path that grew increasingly difficult to discern. The inner disciples used spiritual energy to maintain their footing on terrain that shifted between solid, liquid, and gaseous states without warning. The three outer disciples, including Wei Liang, struggled to keep pace, occasionally slipping or sinking before being impatiently assisted by their superiors.

They passed through areas where time itself seemed damaged. In one clearing, they observed a fallen tree simultaneously rotting into soil and growing from a sapling, its entire lifecycle visible at once. In another, they walked through a zone where their movements left persistent afterimages that faded only gradually, creating a forest of ghost-selves that mimicked their actions with decreasing fidelity.

Throughout the journey, Wei Liang maintained his focus on the immediate task, carefully managing his energy and attention. The Wastes presented constant distractions—whispers that seemed to come from nowhere, visions at the corner of the eye, sensations that couldn't possibly be real. He recognized these as the mental effects Feng Zhao had warned about, the Wastes attempting to corrupt not just body but mind.

After nearly two hours of increasingly difficult travel, they reached their destination—a crater-like depression in the landscape, at the center of which stood the remains of a massive formation array. Stone pillars arranged in concentric circles surrounded a central platform, each carved with symbols that glowed with faint, pulsing light. The entire structure was partially translucent, as if existing simultaneously in multiple reality layers.

Feng Zhao raised his hand, signaling a halt at the crater's edge. "We've arrived. The control node should be at the array's center. Inner disciples will approach in formation. Porters remain here until called."

The inner disciples arranged themselves in a hexagonal pattern and began their careful descent into the crater, spiritual energy visibly circulating between them to maintain a protective barrier. Wei Liang and the other two porters watched from above, the containment vessel a heavy presence on Wei Liang's back.

As the inner disciples reached the first ring of pillars, the array responded. The glowing symbols brightened, and a low hum filled the air, more felt than heard. The ground within the crater began to shimmer, reality becoming even less stable than in the surrounding Wastes.

Wei Liang observed with careful attention, noting how the inner disciples adjusted their formation to counter the array's effects. Feng Zhao led them in a specific pattern, moving from pillar to pillar in what appeared to be a predetermined sequence. Each correct step caused certain symbols to dim while others brightened, gradually opening a path to the center.

It was, Wei Liang realized, a lock—an ancient security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to whatever lay at the array's heart. Feng Zhao must have obtained the correct sequence from Elder Shen or sect records, knowledge that would be incredibly valuable and carefully guarded.

After nearly thirty minutes of methodical progress, the inner disciples reached the central platform. From his position at the crater's edge, Wei Liang could see a pedestal at the center, upon which rested a crystalline object approximately the size of a human heart. Even at this distance, he could sense its wrongness—the way it seemed to bend light and attention around itself, the eye sliding away unless forced to focus.

Feng Zhao gestured, and one of the inner disciples produced a set of specialized tools. Working with extreme caution, they began to disconnect the object from the pedestal, using spiritual energy to counter the occasional flares of power that erupted from the connection points.

"What exactly is that thing?" whispered one of the other porters, his voice tight with apprehension.

"A control node," replied the third porter, an older disciple with more experience. "Part of the array's core. The texts say these ancient arrays could manipulate reality itself—create pocket dimensions, alter fundamental laws within their influence radius."

"And we're taking it back to the sect?" The first porter sounded incredulous. "It's clearly corrupted."

"Elder Shen believes it can be purified and studied," the older disciple said, though his tone suggested personal doubts. "The cultivation insights from before the divine war are worth the risk."

Wei Liang kept his thoughts to himself, but inwardly he agreed with the first porter's concern. The object radiated wrongness in a way that transcended mere corruption. It felt... hungry, somehow. Aware. The containment vessel on his back seemed to grow heavier, as if responding to the proximity of what it was designed to hold.

Below, the inner disciples completed their work. The crystalline node detached from the pedestal with a sound like shattering glass that somehow reversed itself, fragments flying together rather than apart. Feng Zhao quickly encased it in a temporary spiritual barrier, his expression tense with concentration.

The moment the node separated from the pedestal, the entire array began to change. The glowing symbols flared brightly, then started to shift and rearrange themselves. The hum intensified, becoming a discordant vibration that set teeth on edge and made vision blur.

"The array is destabilizing," Feng Zhao called out, his voice carrying to the crater's edge. "We need to leave immediately. Wei Liang, bring the containment vessel down. The rest of you prepare for immediate departure."

Wei Liang didn't hesitate. He made his way down the crater's slope, careful to follow the exact path the inner disciples had taken. The ground beneath his feet felt increasingly insubstantial, as if reality itself was thinning in response to the array's destabilization.

When he reached the inner disciples, Feng Zhao was maintaining the temporary barrier around the node with visible effort. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his hands trembled slightly from the strain.

"Open the vessel," he commanded.

Wei Liang removed the containment vessel from his back and placed it on the ground, releasing the complex series of locks that held it closed. The lid rose with a hiss of escaping pressure, revealing an interior lined with the same materials as the exterior, formation arrays continuing seamlessly inside.

Feng Zhao carefully maneuvered the node toward the open vessel, his spiritual barrier contracting gradually to guide the object into its new container. As the node descended into the vessel, Wei Liang felt a sudden spike of wrongness—the hunger he had sensed earlier intensifying dramatically.

The node touched the bottom of the vessel, and several things happened simultaneously. The array's destabilization accelerated, pillars beginning to phase in and out of reality. A shock wave of corrupted energy burst from the node, disrupting Feng Zhao's spiritual barrier. And most alarmingly, tendrils of crystalline material shot from the node toward the vessel's opening, as if the object was attempting to prevent its containment.

Wei Liang reacted instinctively, slamming the vessel's lid closed before the tendrils could escape. The locks engaged automatically with a series of metallic clicks, and the vessel's formation arrays activated, glowing with power as they contained the node's influence.

"We need to move," Feng Zhao shouted, already backing toward the array's edge. "The entire structure is collapsing!"

The inner disciples retreated in formation, maintaining their protective barrier as reality around them began to fracture more severely. Wei Liang secured the containment vessel to his back once more and followed, the weight now seeming to pulse against his spine like a second heartbeat.

They had nearly reached the first ring of pillars when the array's destabilization reached critical point. A pillar directly in their path phased out of existence, then reappeared in a different position, blocking their carefully plotted exit route.

"Alternative path," Feng Zhao ordered, redirecting the formation toward a different gap between pillars.

They adjusted course, but the array's deterioration was accelerating. Pillars blinked in and out of reality randomly, while the ground beneath them rippled like the surface of a pond. The protective formation around the inner disciples flickered as they struggled to maintain it against the chaotic energies now filling the crater.

Wei Liang focused entirely on keeping his footing and staying within the protective formation's boundary. The vessel on his back grew increasingly active, vibrating against his spine and occasionally emitting high-pitched tones that seemed to interact with the array's destabilization in unpredictable ways.

They were halfway to the crater's edge when disaster struck. A reality fissure opened directly in their path, a vertical tear in the air that revealed glimpses of somewhere else—a void filled with crystalline structures similar to the node they had retrieved. The formation faltered as the inner disciples attempted to adjust their course again.

In that moment of vulnerability, the array released a pulse of energy that swept across the crater like a physical wave. The inner disciples' formation shattered, spiritual connections between them severing as they were thrown in different directions.

Wei Liang was knocked off his feet, the containment vessel's weight driving him hard into the ground. He felt something crack in his chest, pain flaring with each breath. Around him, the other disciples were similarly affected, struggling to regain their footing on ground that now undulated like a living thing.

"Regroup!" Feng Zhao shouted, already pulling himself upright. "Reform the protective barrier!"

The inner disciples staggered toward each other, attempting to reestablish their formation. Wei Liang pushed himself to his knees, then to his feet, ignoring the stabbing pain in his chest. The containment vessel felt heavier than ever, the node inside seeming to pull at him from multiple directions simultaneously.

Another reality fissure opened, then another. The crater was becoming a maze of tears in reality, each offering glimpses of impossible elsewhere. The ground continued to shift, sections rising while others fell, creating a chaotic landscape that changed by the second.

Wei Liang saw Feng Zhao looking back at him, calculating. In that moment, he knew with absolute certainty what was about to happen. He had seen that expression before—the cold assessment of value versus cost, of necessary sacrifice.

"The vessel is destabilizing the array further," Feng Zhao called to the other inner disciples. "We need to move now, before we're trapped."

One of the other inner disciples glanced at Wei Liang, then back to Feng Zhao. "What about the porters?"

"They'll follow as they can," Feng Zhao replied, his tone making it clear that their fate was secondary. "The artifact must be protected."

Wei Liang watched as the inner disciples reformed their protective barrier, now positioned between themselves and the increasingly chaotic center of the array rather than surrounding their entire group. The meaning was clear—they would protect themselves and their retreat path, leaving the porters to fend for themselves.

The other two porters realized their situation at the same moment, their expressions shifting from confusion to fear to desperate determination. They began moving toward the inner disciples, hoping to stay close enough to benefit from the partial protection of their barrier.

Wei Liang made the same calculation but reached a different conclusion. The inner disciples were moving too quickly, prioritizing their own escape. The barrier would not extend to protect the porters, regardless of how closely they followed. And with the containment vessel on his back, he was the slowest of the three.

Instead, he changed direction, moving laterally across the crater toward a section where the reality fissures were less concentrated. If he couldn't follow the inner disciples' path, he would find his own way out.

Behind him, he heard a cry. Glancing back, he saw one of the other porters caught in a reality distortion, his body stretching and compressing in ways that human flesh was never meant to endure. The second porter had nearly reached the inner disciples when a fissure opened directly in his path. He vanished mid-step, not falling into the fissure but simply ceasing to exist in this reality, perhaps shifted to whatever lay on the other side.

Wei Liang turned away, focusing entirely on his own survival. The pain in his chest made each breath a struggle, and the containment vessel's weight threatened to unbalance him with every step. But he had spent his life being overlooked and underestimated, learning to survive in the margins. If anyone could find a path through this chaos, it was him.

He skirted the edge of a reality distortion, feeling the pull of it against his skin like a strong current. The ground beneath his feet solidified briefly, giving him a moment to assess his surroundings. The crater's edge was still distant, but he could see a potential path—a ridge of relatively stable ground that wound between the worst of the fissures.

Wei Liang began to follow this path, moving as quickly as his injured body and heavy burden allowed. Behind him, he could hear the sounds of the array's continued collapse—stone grinding against stone, the crystalline tone of reality fracturing, the distant shouts of the inner disciples as they fought their way toward the crater's edge.

He had nearly reached a promising section of the ridge when he heard footsteps approaching rapidly from behind. Turning, he saw Feng Zhao running toward him, face contorted with anger and fear. The other inner disciples were nowhere to be seen.

"Give me the vessel," Feng Zhao demanded as he reached Wei Liang, his hand already extended. "The others have cleared a path to the edge. This is our only chance."

Wei Liang began to unsling the containment vessel, his movements slowed by pain and caution. As he lifted it from his shoulders, a massive tremor shook the crater. A fissure opened nearby, larger than any before, reality peeling back to reveal a void filled with shifting colors and half-formed shapes.

The ground beneath them tilted suddenly, sending both disciples sliding toward the fissure. Wei Liang managed to catch himself on an outcropping of stone, the containment vessel clutched against his chest. Feng Zhao was less fortunate, sliding several feet before catching himself, now precariously positioned between Wei Liang and the expanding fissure.

For a moment, they stared at each other across the intervening space—the rootless disciple and the cultivation prodigy, their positions suddenly, temporarily equalized by circumstance.

"Throw me the vessel," Feng Zhao called, his voice tight with urgency. "I can get it out safely."

Wei Liang hesitated, assessing the situation with the clarity of someone who had spent his life watching for threats. Feng Zhao's position was unstable, the ground beneath him continuing to shift toward the fissure. The distance between them was significant, making any throw risky. And most tellingly, Feng Zhao's eyes held not just urgency but calculation—the same look Wei Liang had seen when he was selected for this expedition.

"I can make it to the edge with the vessel," Wei Liang replied, already beginning to move along his identified path. "Follow if you can."

Feng Zhao's expression transformed, shock giving way to fury. "You dare? You rootless nothing! That vessel belongs to the sect!"

"And I will return it to the sect," Wei Liang said, continuing his careful movement along the ridge. "If you wish to ensure that happens, help me reach the edge."

For a moment, it seemed Feng Zhao might actually consider cooperation. Then his expression hardened, and he reached for his wooden sword. "You leave me no choice."

Wei Liang had anticipated this response. In Feng Zhao's mind, a rootless disciple refusing an order was unforgivable, regardless of circumstance. He would rather risk the vessel than allow such defiance to stand.

Before Feng Zhao could fully draw his sword, another tremor shook the crater. The ground beneath him gave way completely, and he began to slide directly toward the fissure. His face transformed from anger to terror as he scrabbled for purchase on the disintegrating ground.

Wei Liang had a split-second decision to make. He could attempt to help Feng Zhao, likely resulting in both of them falling into the fissure. Or he could continue along his path, using this moment to escape while Feng Zhao was occupied with his own survival.

The choice was made for him when Feng Zhao, in his desperation, directed a spiritual attack toward Wei Liang—a last attempt to stop him from escaping with the vessel. The green energy of his wood element technique lashed out like a whip, aiming not for Wei Liang directly but for the stone outcropping that provided his stability.

The attack struck true, shattering the outcropping and sending Wei Liang tumbling down the slope. The containment vessel slipped from his grasp, sliding several feet away before coming to rest against a section of broken pillar.

Wei Liang and Feng Zhao locked eyes across the chaotic landscape, both now in equally precarious positions. In that moment of shared peril, Wei Liang saw something unexpected in Feng Zhao's expression—not just fear or anger, but a flicker of recognition. For perhaps the first time, the inner disciple was seeing him not as a rootless nothing but as another person fighting for survival.

The moment passed as quickly as it had come. Feng Zhao turned his attention to saving himself, using his spiritual energy to stabilize the ground beneath him and begin pulling himself away from the fissure's edge.

Wei Liang did the same in his own way, without spiritual energy to aid him. He dug his fingers into the unstable ground, ignoring the pain as stones cut into his flesh. With agonizing slowness, he pulled himself toward the containment vessel, every movement a battle against gravity and the crater's continuing collapse.

He had nearly reached the vessel when he heard a shout of triumph. Feng Zhao had managed to reach a more stable section and was now making his way toward the vessel as well, his movements enhanced by spiritual energy.

It would be a race, and one Wei Liang could not win. Without cultivation, he could not match Feng Zhao's speed or strength. The inner disciple would reach the vessel first, claim it, and leave Wei Liang behind to die in the collapsing array.

Unless...

Wei Liang changed direction, no longer moving toward the vessel but toward a nearby reality fissure—smaller than the one that had nearly claimed Feng Zhao, but still a tear in the fabric of existence. He positioned himself between this fissure and the vessel, then called out.

"Feng Zhao! The vessel is yours if you can claim it!"

The inner disciple's head snapped up, eyes narrowing at Wei Liang's apparent surrender. He altered his course slightly, moving more directly toward the containment vessel, his focus entirely on his prize.

Wei Liang waited until Feng Zhao was fully committed to his approach, then acted. With all his remaining strength, he slammed his fist into the ground at a specific point—a stress fracture he had identified in the crater's surface, where reality seemed thinnest.

The effect was immediate and catastrophic. The fracture expanded explosively, connecting with the nearby fissure and causing it to widen dramatically. The ground between Feng Zhao and the vessel collapsed, creating a chasm that opened directly into the reality tear.

Feng Zhao's momentum carried him forward into empty space. His expression transformed from triumph to disbelief as he began to fall. In the last moment before the fissure claimed him, he lashed out with spiritual energy, a desperate attack aimed at Wei Liang.

The green energy whip caught Wei Liang across the chest, slicing through his robes and into flesh. Pain exploded through his body, driving the air from his lungs. He fell backward, blood soaking his robes, as Feng Zhao disappeared into the fissure with a final cry of rage and terror.

For several moments, Wei Liang lay on the shuddering ground, consciousness flickering as pain and blood loss threatened to overwhelm him. The array's collapse continued around him, reality breaking down in increasingly violent ways. If he remained, death was certain—either from his wounds or from the array's destruction.

With effort that sent fresh waves of agony through his body, Wei Liang rolled onto his stomach and began crawling toward the containment vessel. Each movement was torture, each breath a struggle against the damage to his chest. Blood trailed behind him, marking his path across the broken ground.

When he finally reached the vessel, he had barely enough strength to secure it to his back once more. The weight nearly drove him flat again, his injured body protesting the additional burden. But something beyond physical strength kept him moving—a determination born from a lifetime of enduring what should have broken him.

Wei Liang began the torturous journey toward the crater's edge, following the path he had identified earlier. The array's collapse had accelerated, pillars now completely detached from reality, floating and spinning in defiance of physics. The ground phased between solid and intangible, requiring careful timing for each step.

His vision began to narrow, darkness creeping in from the edges as blood loss took its toll. Still, he continued, one agonizing step after another. When he could no longer walk, he crawled. When crawling became impossible, he pulled himself forward by his fingertips, the containment vessel dragging behind him.

After what seemed like eternity, Wei Liang reached the crater's edge. He lay there, breath coming in ragged gasps, blood pooling beneath him. The containment vessel pulsed against his back, the node inside seeming to respond to his fading life force.

With the last of his strength, Wei Liang pulled himself over the edge, tumbling down the outer slope until he came to rest on relatively stable ground beyond the array's immediate influence. The sky above him shifted between day and night in rapid cycles, a visual representation of reality's damage in this place.

As consciousness began to slip away, Wei Liang became aware of a presence nearby—not physical, but a pressure against his mind. Something ancient and patient, watching him with interest. The containment vessel grew warm against his back, the node inside resonating with whatever observed him.

In his last moments of clarity, Wei Liang understood what was happening. The node had been more than a control component—it was a fragment of something sentient, something that had waited in the array since the divine war. And now, as his life ebbed away, it reached out to him.

*Empty vessel*, a voice whispered in his mind, though it used no language he recognized. *Hollow one. You who have been carved out by rejection and pain. You are suitable.*

Wei Liang tried to resist, some instinct warning him against whatever was happening. But his strength was gone, his will fading with his blood into the corrupted soil of the Shattered Wastes.

*Do not fight*, the voice continued. *You sought power. You sought recognition. I offer both, and more. All that was denied you shall be yours. All who denied you shall know your name and tremble.*

Darkness claimed the edges of Wei Liang's vision, his heartbeat slowing to a faint, erratic rhythm. In this moment between life and death, suspended in the broken reality of the Wastes, he made his final choice.

*Yes*, he thought, surrendering to the presence that reached for him. *Yes.*

The containment vessel shattered, formation arrays failing as the node inside exerted its full power. Crystalline shards pierced Wei Liang's back, but he felt no pain—only a cold rush as something ancient and terrible flowed into him through the wounds, filling the emptiness where a spirit root should have been.

His body arched, mouth opening in a silent scream as the foreign power rewrote him from within. Blood that had been flowing outward reversed direction, drawing back into his body along with the crystalline fragments, his wounds sealing not with healing but with transformation.

Above him, the chaotic sky stabilized momentarily, as if the very Wastes held their breath to witness what was occurring. Then darkness fell completely, not just over Wei Liang's vision but over the landscape itself, a void that spread outward from his transformed body.

When light returned, Wei Liang was gone. In his place lay something both more and less—a figure that resembled him in form but not in essence. Eyes that had once been human now held depths that reflected the void between stars. Skin that had been warm and alive now bore the faint translucence of fine porcelain, with hairline cracks visible beneath the surface.

The figure that had been Wei Liang sat up slowly, movements unnaturally fluid, as if joints and muscles operated according to different principles. It examined its hands with detached curiosity, turning them over to study the network of dark veins visible beneath the pale skin.

When it finally stood, the ground beneath its feet frosted over, reality itself recoiling from its touch. It looked back at the crater where the array continued its collapse, expression unreadable. Then it turned away, gaze fixing on the distant horizon where the Azure Peaks were just visible through the Wastes' distortion.

Something like a smile crossed its face—not an expression of joy, but of purpose found. Of vengeance awakened. Of power where once there had been only emptiness.

The Forgotten Path had found its disciple. And Wei Liang, the rootless nothing, had taken his first step toward becoming something the cultivation world would learn to fear.



# Chapter 4: The Void Between

Death was not what Wei Liang had expected.

There was no sudden darkness, no immediate release. Instead, consciousness ebbed and flowed like a tide against broken shores. One moment, he felt the sharp stones beneath his back, the next, nothing at all. His blood—warm then cold—pooled beneath him, seeping into the corrupted soil of the Shattered Wastes.

Pain came in waves. When present, it consumed everything—a symphony of agony as his body struggled against the inevitable. The wound across his chest burned as though Feng Zhao's spiritual attack still sliced through him, over and over, an endless loop of betrayal made physical.

Then, mercifully, the pain would recede, replaced by a floating sensation. In these moments, Wei Liang found himself elsewhere—or perhaps nowhere at all.

*Is this dying?* The thought drifted through his mind, detached and curious rather than frightened. *So slow. So... incomplete.*

Time lost meaning. The sky above him cycled through impossible colors—the fractured reality of the Wastes reflecting his fractured consciousness. Sometimes it appeared as normal daylight, other times as deepest night studded with stars that moved in patterns no astronomer had ever recorded. Occasionally, it became something else entirely—a swirling void that seemed to watch him with patient interest.

During one moment of clarity, Wei Liang tried to move. His body refused to respond, heavy and distant as though it belonged to someone else. Only his eyes obeyed, allowing him to see the extent of his situation. The containment vessel lay shattered beside him, crystalline shards scattered across the ground. The node it had held was nowhere to be seen, though the air around him shimmered with residual energy.

His robes were soaked through with blood—too much blood for anyone to survive losing. The rational part of his mind, still functioning despite everything, calculated that he should already be dead. That he remained conscious at all defied explanation.

Darkness claimed him again, deeper this time. When awareness returned, the quality of light had changed. How much time had passed? Hours? Days? In the Wastes, such distinctions meant little.

A sound reached him—not physical, but a vibration that resonated directly in his mind. It reminded him of the whispers he had heard when passing through the reality fissure, but clearer now, more focused. As if whatever spoke had found its intended audience.

*Empty vessel,* it seemed to say, though no words were actually spoken. *Hollow one.*

Wei Liang tried to respond but could form no words. His lips were cracked, his throat parched beyond function. Instead, he directed his thoughts toward the presence he sensed.

*Who are you?*

No answer came, but the air around him grew heavier, charged with potential. The shattered fragments of the containment vessel began to vibrate, tiny crystalline notes rising into a discordant melody.

Darkness claimed him once more.

When consciousness returned, Wei Liang found himself standing in the Azure Peaks Sect's main courtyard. The familiar stone paths and elegant buildings surrounded him, exactly as he remembered. Disciples moved about their daily routines—practicing formations, carrying supplies, hurrying to lessons.

None looked at him. None acknowledged his presence.

*A memory,* he realized. *Or a dying dream.*

He tried to touch a passing disciple, but his hand passed through the young man's shoulder like smoke. The sensation was disorienting—he could feel his body moving, yet it had no substance in this place.

Wei Liang wandered through the memory-sect, observing scenes from his life there. He saw himself as a child, newly arrived, sleeping in the servants' quarters with other orphans and castoffs. He watched his younger self carrying water, sweeping floors, enduring casual cruelty with downcast eyes.

The scenes shifted forward in time. He witnessed his unexpected elevation to outer disciple status, the confusion and resentment it generated among the other servants. He saw Master Jing examining him with clinical interest, making notes in a leather-bound book while young Wei Liang performed basic exercises that never produced a hint of spiritual energy.

*Why did you elevate me?* Wei Liang wondered, watching the elder's inscrutable face. *What were you looking for?*

The memory offered no answers, simply fading into another: Wei Liang in the sect library, secretly reading cultivation manuals by candlelight, memorizing meridian paths and energy circulation techniques he could never implement.

Each memory flowed into the next without clear transitions. He saw countless moments of humiliation at Feng Zhao's hands, each one burning with fresh pain despite the years that had passed. He witnessed his own stubborn persistence, the quiet defiance that had kept him going when surrender would have been easier.

Then came newer memories—the expedition preparations, the journey to the Wastes, the fateful moment when Feng Zhao's spiritual attack had torn through his chest.

The memories began to fragment, breaking apart like the shattered containment vessel. Pieces disappeared, leaving gaps in the narrative of his life. Wei Liang tried to hold onto them, suddenly desperate not to lose these parts of himself, but they slipped away like water through cupped hands.

*No,* he thought, reaching for a fading image of his first day in the sect. *Don't take that. It's mine.*

*Is it?* The voice that wasn't a voice returned, resonating through the dissolving memories. *What use are such things to one who walks the Forgotten Path?*

The courtyard scene shattered completely, replaced by darkness so absolute it seemed to have substance. Wei Liang felt himself falling through it, or perhaps it was falling through him—direction had no meaning in this void.

*What is happening to me?* he asked the darkness.

*Transformation,* came the reply. *The vessel breaks so that it may be filled.*

Before Wei Liang could question this cryptic answer, the darkness receded. He found himself in a new location—not a memory this time, but somewhere he had never been.

A vast chamber stretched around him, its walls, floor, and ceiling formed from the same crystalline material as the node from the array. The space pulsed with energy that flowed in visible currents, like rivers of light streaming through the air. At the center stood a formation array far more complex than the one they had found in the Wastes—a perfect circle of pillars surrounding a raised platform.

Upon the platform stood figures that defied description. They were humanoid in basic shape, but their forms shifted constantly, as if reality itself couldn't decide on their appearance. They moved with purpose, manipulating the energy currents, shaping them into patterns that hurt Wei Liang's mind to observe.

*The forgotten gods,* he realized with sudden certainty. *Before the cataclysm. Before they were forgotten.*

He was witnessing something impossible—a moment from before the divine war, preserved somehow in the corrupted reality of the Wastes. Or perhaps created by his dying mind as it struggled to make sense of what was happening to him.

One of the figures paused in its work, turning toward Wei Liang as if sensing his presence across the vast gulf of time. Its face—if it could be called a face—seemed to focus, features resolving momentarily into something almost human.

It spoke, and though Wei Liang couldn't hear the words, he felt their meaning imprint directly upon his consciousness:

*We created the paths to ascension, the methods by which lesser beings might approach our state. But for every path forged, a shadow path forms—an inverse, a reflection. We hid these shadow paths, for they lead to power through destruction rather than creation.*

The figure's form began to blur again, its momentary clarity fading.

*The Forgotten Path is one such shadow. It consumes rather than builds. It empties rather than fills. It breaks rather than forges. And yet, in breaking, it creates something new—something that should not be.*

The vision began to dissolve, the crystalline chamber breaking apart into fragments that swirled around Wei Liang like a storm.

*Why show me this?* Wei Liang asked as the fragments closed in around him.

*You have already chosen,* came the reply, though whether from the figure or from somewhere else, he couldn't tell. *I merely show you what your choice means.*

The fragments struck him all at once, a thousand crystalline shards piercing his form. There was no pain—his body wasn't really here, after all—but he felt each entry as a cold shock, like plunging into winter water. The shards didn't stop at his skin but continued inward, replacing blood and bone and tissue with their crystalline substance.

Wei Liang tried to scream, but his mouth was gone, replaced by the same crystal that now formed the rest of him. For a moment, he was aware of himself as something inhuman—a crystalline statue in the shape of a man, hollow inside, waiting to be filled.

Then even that awareness shattered.

He fell back into his broken body on the corrupted soil of the Wastes. Pain returned, but different now—not the sharp agony of a wound, but the deep ache of transformation. His blood no longer flowed outward but seemed to be changing within his veins, becoming something else entirely.

The sky above had settled into perpetual twilight, neither day nor night but the boundary between them. Wei Liang found he could see more clearly in this half-light than he ever had in full day—details that should have been lost in shadow were perfectly visible, as if darkness itself had become a lens rather than an obscurement.

*Get up.*

The command came from within and without simultaneously—his own thought and something else's, indistinguishable from each other. His body, which had been unresponsive for what felt like eternity, suddenly obeyed. Muscles that should have been too damaged to function contracted smoothly. Limbs that should have been stiff with rigor moved with fluid grace.

Wei Liang stood, looking down at himself with detached curiosity. The wound across his chest remained, but it no longer bled. Instead, the edges had sealed with something that resembled frost, tiny crystalline structures binding the torn flesh together. His robes, stiff with dried blood, cracked and flaked as he moved, revealing skin beneath that was paler than it should have been, with a faint translucence like fine porcelain.

He raised a hand to his face, fingers exploring features that felt both familiar and strange. His cheeks were hollowed, his eyes sunken deeper into their sockets. When he touched his chest, he felt no heartbeat—or rather, he felt something pulsing, but at a rhythm too slow and irregular to sustain human life.

*What am I becoming?* he wondered, the question directed at both himself and the presence he still sensed within him.

*The first disciple of the Forgotten Path in an age,* came the reply. *The vessel through which the forgotten shall return to memory.*

Wei Liang looked around, seeing the Shattered Wastes with new eyes. The corruption and distortion that had seemed so alien before now appeared almost beautiful—a canvas of possibility where reality could be rewritten. The very wrongness of this place resonated with the wrongness now growing within him.

He took a step, then another, testing this new body that was his yet not entirely his. Movement came easily, too easily—as if gravity had less hold on him than before. The ground beneath his feet frosted slightly where he stepped, tiny crystals forming and then sublimating back into the air.

A sound caught his attention—a distant cry of pain or fear. Wei Liang turned toward it, his senses extending beyond normal human range. He could perceive the source: a group of disciples, Azure Peaks by their robes, moving cautiously through the Wastes perhaps half a mile away. A search party, he realized. Looking for survivors. Looking for the artifact.

Looking for him.

Something stirred within Wei Liang at the sight of those familiar robes—a complex emotion that took him a moment to identify. Not quite anger, not quite hatred, but a cold, implacable purpose. These were Feng Zhao's people. The ones who had left him to die. The ones who upheld a system that had deemed him worthless from birth.

*They will not recognize you now,* the voice within him suggested. *You could approach. Listen. Learn.*

Wei Liang considered this. Part of him—the calculating survivor who had endured years of abuse at the sect—appreciated the tactical advantage. But another part, the part that was rapidly becoming dominant, wanted something else entirely.

He wanted them to know exactly who he was. He wanted to see the recognition in their eyes, followed by the fear. He wanted them to understand that the rootless nothing they had discarded had returned as something terrible.

*Patience,* the voice counseled. *You are newly born to this path. Your power is but a fraction of what it will become.*

Reluctantly, Wei Liang acknowledged the wisdom in this. He was changed, yes, but still vulnerable. Still learning what he had become. The time for confrontation would come, but not yet.

He turned away from the search party, moving deeper into the Wastes. Each step felt more natural than the last as he adjusted to his transformed body. The pain had faded entirely now, replaced by a strange hollowness—an emptiness at his core that somehow didn't feel like absence but like potential.

As he walked, Wei Liang became aware of another sensation: hunger. Not physical hunger for food—he suspected his body no longer required such sustenance—but a deeper, more fundamental craving. A hunger for something he couldn't name but could sense all around him in the corrupted energy of the Wastes.

Instinctively, he reached out with senses he hadn't possessed before, drawing some of that energy toward him. It came willingly, almost eagerly, flowing into the emptiness within him like water into a vessel. The sensation was intoxicating—a rush of power unlike anything he had experienced in his previous life.

For someone who had been denied spiritual energy his entire existence, who had been told repeatedly that he lacked the fundamental capacity to cultivate, this moment was revelation. The irony wasn't lost on him: he had finally found a path to power, but only after being broken beyond repair.

*Not broken,* the voice corrected. *Emptied. The rootless are rare and precious—vessels without predetermined shape, capable of holding what others cannot.*

Wei Liang absorbed this information as he continued walking, putting distance between himself and the search party. The landscape around him grew increasingly distorted—reality fissures more frequent, gravity more variable, time flowing at inconsistent rates. None of these phenomena bothered him now. If anything, he felt more at home in these broken spaces than he ever had in the ordered world of the sect.

He came to a place where a reality fissure had torn open a permanent gap between locations. Through it, he could see a different part of the Wastes—a valley filled with crystalline formations similar to the node from the array. The sight triggered a resonance within him, a recognition that drew him forward.

Wei Liang stepped through the fissure without hesitation, experiencing a momentary sensation of being everywhere and nowhere simultaneously before emerging on the other side. The valley spread before him, glittering in the perpetual twilight. At its center stood a single structure—not a building in the conventional sense, but a formation of crystal that had grown into the rough shape of a pavilion.

He approached it, drawn by an instinct he didn't fully understand. As he drew closer, he saw that the crystalline structure was covered in script—the same ancient writing that had adorned the array and the containment vessel. Here, however, the script was more extensive, forming complete passages rather than fragmentary phrases.

Wei Liang reached out, fingers tracing the symbols. To his surprise, he could understand them—not through knowledge of the language, but through a direct comprehension that bypassed normal translation. The writing described the Forgotten Path in detail—its origins, its stages, its powers and costs.

*The First Hollowing,* he read. *The vessel is emptied through trauma, creating space for the void to enter. The body survives while the self begins to erode. The Hollowborn can absorb minor spiritual attacks, conceal their presence from spiritual senses, and convert pain to power.*

Wei Liang recognized his current state in this description. The Hollowborn—the first stage of the Forgotten Path. The beginning of a journey that would transform him further with each step.

He continued reading, learning of the stages that awaited him: Fracture, Void, Unmaker, and finally, the Nameless. Each promised greater power, and each demanded greater sacrifice—memories, identity, humanity itself.

The price was high. But as Wei Liang stood in the valley of crystals, the emptiness within him hungering for fulfillment, he found he did not care. What use was humanity to one who had been treated as less than human? What value were memories of pain and rejection? What worth was an identity forged in the crucible of others' contempt?

He had been Wei Liang, the rootless disciple, the eternal servant, the expendable tool. That person had died in the Wastes, betrayed by those he had served faithfully.

What rose in his place would be something else entirely. Something that would make Feng Zhao and the Azure Peaks Sect remember the one they had tried to forget.

As this resolution crystallized within him, Wei Liang felt a shift in his transformed body. The emptiness at his core pulsed, responding to his determination. The script on the crystalline pavilion began to glow, resonating with the same energy.

*The Path recognizes its disciple,* the voice within him observed. *Now begins your true cultivation.*

Wei Liang raised his hands before his face, watching as the veins beneath his translucent skin darkened, carrying something that was no longer blood through his transformed body. The frost-like substance that had sealed his chest wound spread slightly, forming patterns like branching crystals across his skin.

He closed his eyes, turning his awareness inward as he had practiced countless times while studying forbidden cultivation manuals. But where those attempts had always met with failure—the absence of a spirit root preventing any circulation of energy—now he found something responding.

Not a core of energy forming in his dantian, as traditional cultivation would create, but rather a controlled emptiness—a void that could draw in and consume energy from outside himself. The opposite of traditional cultivation, which generated power from within. The Forgotten Path instead devoured power from without.

Wei Liang opened his eyes, seeing the world differently yet again. Energy patterns were visible to him now—currents and eddies of spiritual power flowing through the corrupted landscape of the Wastes. Some were bright and pure, others twisted and distorted, but all were potentially his to consume.

He extended his awareness, testing this new perception. In the distance, he could sense the search party from Azure Peaks more clearly now—not just their physical presence but the glow of their cultivation. Each disciple shone like a lantern in his enhanced perception, their carefully cultivated spiritual energy a beacon that both attracted and repelled him.

The hunger within him surged at the sight, urging him to approach, to consume, to devour the power they had built over years of privileged cultivation. It would be so easy to ambush a straggler, to feed this new emptiness with stolen energy.

*Not yet,* Wei Liang told himself, forcing the hunger back. *Not until I understand what I've become. Not until I can make them understand what they've created.*

He turned away from the temptation, focusing instead on the crystalline pavilion and its ancient knowledge. Here, in this forgotten place, he would learn. He would master this inverse path of cultivation. He would embrace the emptiness and the hunger, turning them from weaknesses into weapons.

And when he was ready—when the rootless nothing had become something terrible and powerful—he would return to those who had discarded him. Not for mere revenge, but for recognition. To force them to see what their actions had wrought. To make them remember what they had tried to forget.

In the perpetual twilight of the Shattered Wastes, Wei Liang—or what had once been Wei Liang—began his study of the Forgotten Path. The first disciple in an age of a cultivation method that should have remained lost. The empty vessel now being filled with something ancient and ruinous.

Above him, the fractured sky continued its impossible cycles, indifferent to the transformation occurring below. Around him, the corrupted landscape of the Wastes pulsed with energies that resonated with his new nature. And within him, the voice that was both his and not his whispered secrets of power that no living cultivator remembered.

The void between life and death, between human and other, between forgotten and remembered—this was where Wei Liang now existed. And from this liminal space, he would forge a path that would shake the foundations of the cultivation world.

One empty step at a time.



# Chapter 5: Hollowborn

The search party from Azure Peaks Sect moved through the Shattered Wastes like frightened children, huddled together in tight formation, spiritual energy flaring at every unexpected sound. Wei Liang watched them from the shadow of a crystalline outcropping, his newly awakened senses perceiving their fear as clearly as he saw their faces.

Three days had passed since his transformation—or perhaps it had been longer. Time flowed strangely in the Wastes, and stranger still in his altered perception. He had spent these days learning the limits of his new form, testing abilities that would have been impossible in his previous life.

The emptiness within him had grown familiar, a constant hunger that whispered for fulfillment. He had fed it small portions—corrupted energy from the Wastes, ambient spiritual residue from the ancient battlefield—but these were mere morsels. Unsatisfying. The true feast, his instincts told him, would be the cultivated energy of living disciples.

Wei Liang shifted position, moving with unnatural silence. His body felt lighter now, disconnected from normal physical constraints. The wound across his chest had fully sealed, leaving a crystalline scar that occasionally pulsed with dark energy. His skin had grown paler, taking on a translucent quality that revealed shadowed veins beneath. His eyes, when he had glimpsed their reflection in a pool of still water, had become unnaturally deep-set, almost sunken, with an intensity that hadn't been there before.

The Hollowborn. First stage of the Forgotten Path.

The search party paused at a junction where three paths converged. Wei Liang recognized their leader—Disciple Chen, the youngest of the inner disciples who had accompanied Feng Zhao on the expedition. The one who had occasionally shown him small kindnesses. The one who had warned him before they entered the Wastes.

"We've searched this quadrant for three days," one of the other disciples was saying, voice tight with strain. "If Wei Liang survived, we would have found some trace by now."

"Elder Shen's orders were clear," Chen replied, his expression troubled. "We must confirm his status, one way or another."

"He was cut down by Senior Brother Feng," another disciple argued. "No one could survive such a wound, especially not a rootless disciple with no cultivation."

Wei Liang felt a cold amusement at their certainty. How little they understood about survival. About adaptation. About the power that could be found in emptiness.

"And the artifact?" Chen asked, changing the subject. "Any sign of the containment vessel?"

The disciples exchanged uneasy glances. "Nothing. The array site is completely destabilized. Reality fissures have made thorough exploration impossible."

Chen's face hardened. "Elder Shen won't be pleased. That artifact was the mission's primary objective."

"Senior Brother Feng said the vessel was lost when Wei Liang tried to flee with it," one disciple offered. "Perhaps it was pulled into a fissure."

The lie hung in the air, obvious even to those who hadn't witnessed the truth. Wei Liang wondered if Feng Zhao had made it back to the sect, or if the reality fissure had claimed him permanently. The thought brought neither satisfaction nor disappointment—just a detached curiosity.

"We'll make one final sweep toward the eastern boundary," Chen decided. "If we find nothing by nightfall, we return to the sect."

The disciples nodded, relief evident in their postures. None of them wanted to remain in the Wastes any longer than necessary. The corruption here affected even those with strong cultivation, subtle distortions of perception and thought that grew more pronounced with exposure.

Wei Liang waited until they had moved a sufficient distance away before emerging from his hiding place. He could follow them easily—his new senses could track the glow of their spiritual energy even beyond visual range—but direct confrontation served no purpose yet. Better to observe. To learn. To plan.

He turned instead toward the crystalline pavilion he had claimed as his temporary sanctuary. The ancient structure had become his dwelling and his teacher, its inscriptions revealing secrets of the Forgotten Path that no living cultivator remembered. Each day, he absorbed more knowledge, understanding more fully what he was becoming.

The pavilion stood in the center of the crystal valley, its translucent walls catching the perpetual twilight and refracting it into impossible colors. As Wei Liang approached, he felt the structure respond to his presence—a subtle resonance between the emptiness within him and the ancient power contained in the crystals.

He entered through an archway that had no door, moving into the main chamber where the densest concentration of inscriptions covered the walls. The space felt both alien and familiar now, a reflection of his own transformed state.

Wei Liang settled into a cross-legged position at the chamber's center, closing his eyes and turning his awareness inward. The emptiness at his core pulsed in response, a void that hungered for fulfillment. He had learned to control this hunger somewhat, to direct it rather than being directed by it, but the effort required constant vigilance.

According to the inscriptions, the Hollowborn stage was merely the beginning—the emptying that created space for what was to come. To progress further along the Forgotten Path, he would need to consume cultivated spiritual energy directly from its source. He would need to feed on those who had what he had been denied.

The thought should have disturbed him. In his previous life, he had clung to whatever scraps of morality he could afford—small kindnesses, minor principles that separated him from true monsters. But that person had died in the Wastes, betrayed and abandoned. What rose in his place viewed morality as just another luxury denied to the rootless.

A sound from outside the pavilion broke his meditation—a crystalline chime that served as warning. Something approached. Something powerful.

Wei Liang rose fluidly, moving to the archway with preternatural speed. Outside, the twilight had deepened, shadows stretching across the valley floor. Among those shadows moved a figure that seemed composed of darkness itself—a woman-shaped absence that absorbed light rather than reflecting it.

He watched her approach, neither hiding nor revealing himself. His new senses extended, trying to gauge her nature, but encountered only a void similar to his own—an emptiness that hunger couldn't penetrate.

The figure stopped at the base of the pavilion steps, head tilted upward as if examining the structure. When she spoke, her voice had an echo quality, as if reaching him from a great distance despite her proximity.

"The Forgotten Path finds a new disciple," she said, the words neither question nor greeting but simple observation. "How unexpected."

Wei Liang stepped fully into the archway, allowing himself to be seen. "Who are you?"

The figure's form shifted slightly, darkness flowing like liquid. "Names have power, Hollowborn. I surrendered mine long ago." She gestured at herself. "Those who notice me at all call me the Hollow Woman. It serves well enough."

The title resonated with Wei Liang's new knowledge. The inscriptions had mentioned others who had walked the Forgotten Path in ages past—most driven mad by the transformation, a few achieving terrible power before being destroyed by those who upheld the traditional cultivation order.

"You walk the same path," he said, recognizing the similarity in their emptiness.

"Walked," she corrected. "I reached its end long ago, then turned back from the final threshold. Now I merely exist in the spaces between, neither progressing nor regressing."

Wei Liang descended the pavilion steps, closing the distance between them. As he drew nearer, he could see that her form wasn't truly featureless—within the darkness were suggestions of a face, limbs, clothing. Like a person viewed through deep water, details obscured but presence undeniable.

"Why turn back?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's laugh held no humor. "The final stage requires complete surrender of self. I discovered, too late, that I valued what remained of mine." Her form shifted again, darkness coalescing into slightly greater definition. "But you didn't invite me to your philosophical discussion. I came uninvited."

"Why?"

"Curiosity," she said. "It has been centuries since anyone new walked this path. The traditional cultivation sects have been... thorough in their suppression of knowledge."

Wei Liang considered this. The inscriptions had hinted at systematic destruction of information about the Forgotten Path, but hearing confirmation from one who had witnessed it firsthand gave the knowledge new weight.

"They fear what they cannot control," he said.

"With good reason." The Hollow Woman gestured at the valley around them. "The Forgotten Path consumes. It breaks. It unmakes. The traditional paths build and refine—they create stability. We..." She paused. "We create change through destruction. Few civilizations welcome such force within their borders."

Wei Liang absorbed this, finding no argument against her assessment. The hunger within him didn't care for stability or civilization—it wanted only to consume, to grow stronger through the absorption of others' power.

"You didn't answer my first question," he said. "Why are you here? Mere curiosity seems insufficient motivation."

The darkness around her rippled, an equivalent of a shrug perhaps. "The Wastes preserve what should be forgotten. I am its most faithful guardian in that respect." She studied him with eyes he couldn't see but could feel. "When something new emerges—something that walks between traditional cultivation and true corruption—I take notice."

"And then?"

"That depends on you, Hollowborn." She moved closer, her form flowing rather than stepping. "What do you seek from this path? Power? Revenge? Transcendence?"

The question struck deeper than Wei Liang expected. In the days since his transformation, he had focused on survival and understanding, not ultimate purpose. The hunger provided direction but not meaning.

"Recognition," he finally said, the word emerging from some place deeper than thought. "To be seen. To matter. To force those who deemed me nothing to acknowledge what I've become."

The Hollow Woman was silent for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice held a new quality—something almost like sympathy, though filtered through centuries of detachment.

"A dangerous purpose," she said. "More dangerous than you know."

"Why?"

"Because it keeps you bound to them. To their judgment. To their values." Her form expanded slightly, darkness spreading like ink in water. "The true power of the Forgotten Path comes when you no longer care what others see when they look at you."

Wei Liang felt resistance rise within him—not from the hunger, but from the remnants of the person he had been. The servant boy who had endured countless humiliations while dreaming of the day his worth would be recognized. The rootless disciple who had memorized cultivation techniques he could never perform, hoping somehow to transcend his limitations.

"Then what purpose would you suggest?" he asked, unable to keep a edge from his voice.

"I suggest nothing," she replied. "I merely observe that purposes, like names, can become chains. The Forgotten Path offers freedom from such constraints—but only if you're willing to forget what bound you in the first place."

Before Wei Liang could respond, a distant sound caught his attention—voices carried on the wind, approaching from the valley's edge. The search party had changed direction, now moving toward their location.

The Hollow Woman noticed his shift in attention. "Ah. Your former sect-mates approach. Will you hide again, or will you show them what you've become?"

The question wasn't mocking but seemed genuinely curious. Wei Liang considered his options. He was stronger than before, but still new to his abilities. Confronting multiple cultivators, even with the element of surprise, carried significant risk.

"I'm not ready," he admitted, the words difficult to speak.

"Wisdom rare in the newly transformed," the Hollow Woman noted with what might have been approval. "Come. I know paths through the Wastes that even the search parties won't find."

She turned, flowing toward a narrow gap between crystal formations. Wei Liang hesitated only briefly before following. The pavilion had taught him much, but a living guide who had walked the same path offered knowledge of a different kind.

They moved through the crystal valley in silence, the Hollow Woman leading him along routes that seemed to shift as they traversed them—paths that existed in the spaces between stable reality. Wei Liang found he could navigate these liminal spaces with increasing ease, his transformed nature resonating with their instability.

The voices of the search party faded behind them as they entered a region of the Wastes he hadn't explored before. Here, the corruption manifested differently—not in obvious distortions of physics or reality, but in subtle wrongness that was almost more disturbing. Trees that looked normal until one noticed they cast no shadows. Rocks that remained perfectly dry despite the stream flowing over them. Birds that flew in place, never advancing despite their beating wings.

"The Quiet Wastes," the Hollow Woman explained without being asked. "Where corruption turns inward rather than outward. Few cultivators venture here—the distortions are harder to detect until it's too late."

"Too late for what?" Wei Liang asked.

"For them to realize their own cultivation has been inverted." Her form seemed to smile, though he couldn't see her face clearly. "A cultivator might spend hours here, believing they're strengthening their core, only to discover they've been systematically dismantling it instead."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. "But we're immune?"

"Not immune. Compatible." She gestured at their surroundings. "The Forgotten Path is itself an inversion—consumption rather than generation, emptying rather than filling. The corruption here operates on similar principles."

They continued through the Quiet Wastes until they reached a clearing where a single structure stood—a small cottage that appeared ordinary except for the fact that it was constructed entirely upside-down, its roof serving as floor, its door accessible only by walking up walls that functioned as ground.

The Hollow Woman flowed up the inverted wall without difficulty. Wei Liang followed more cautiously, discovering that his body responded to his intention rather than normal physics. Gravity reoriented as he moved, making the impossible transition feel natural.

Inside, the cottage was larger than its exterior suggested—another spatial distortion that no longer surprised him. Furnishings were minimal and strange: chairs that faced walls, tables with objects affixed to their undersides, windows that showed scenes from places that couldn't possibly be visible from this location.

"My dwelling," the Hollow Woman said, her form settling into a more defined shape in these familiar surroundings. "One of several I maintain throughout the Wastes."

Wei Liang examined the space with interest. "You've lived here long?"

"Time is flexible in the Wastes," she replied, "but yes, by any meaningful measure. Since before the Azure Peaks Sect existed. Since before most of the current cultivation world took shape."

The casual mention of such vast timeframes gave Wei Liang pause. The inscriptions had hinted at the longevity granted by the Forgotten Path, but hearing it confirmed made the reality more concrete.

"How far did you progress?" he asked. "Before turning back from the final threshold?"

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely, darkness condensing until he could almost make out features—a woman's face, ageless and severe, with eyes that held no color but infinite depth.

"The Unmaker," she said. "Fourth stage. One step from the Nameless."

Wei Liang recalled the inscriptions describing these advanced stages. The Unmaker could corrupt reality itself, rewriting small aspects of the world through sheer will. Such power seemed godlike, yet she spoke of it with what sounded like regret.

"And now?" he asked.

"Now I exist between stages. Neither advancing nor retreating." Her form expanded again, features fading back into darkness. "The price of indecision."

Wei Liang sensed there was more to her story—centuries of existence compressed into those simple statements—but he didn't press. Instead, he turned his attention to more immediate concerns.

"The search party will report back to the sect soon," he said. "They'll declare me dead if they haven't already."

"And is that not advantageous?" the Hollow Woman asked. "To be forgotten by those who would hunt you? To have time to grow stronger without interference?"

"Perhaps," Wei Liang conceded. "But it feels like..." He struggled to articulate the discomfort. "Like they win. Like Feng Zhao's betrayal succeeds."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been a sigh. "You remain bound to their recognition, even now. Even after the Path has begun to transform you." She moved closer, her darkness cool against his skin. "Let me show you something."

She gestured, and one of the windows changed its view, no longer showing an impossible landscape but a scene Wei Liang recognized—the Azure Peaks Sect's main hall. Within it stood Elder Shen, severe and imposing, addressing a group that included Feng Zhao.

"How—" Wei Liang began.

"The Wastes connect to many places," the Hollow Woman explained. "With sufficient understanding, one can glimpse through these connections. Listen."

Sound accompanied the image now, Elder Shen's voice crisp and authoritative: "...no confirmation of death, but given the circumstances, we must assume Disciple Wei did not survive. The containment vessel and artifact are also lost. This expedition has failed in its primary objective."

Feng Zhao bowed, his expression appropriately solemn. "This disciple takes full responsibility. The array's destabilization was more severe than anticipated. Wei Liang panicked and fled with the vessel despite my orders to remain in formation. When I pursued, a reality fissure opened between us. I was fortunate to escape with my life."

The lie was delivered with perfect conviction, not a hint of the truth showing in Feng Zhao's face or voice. Wei Liang felt a cold rage building within him, the hunger in his core responding to his emotions, growing sharper and more insistent.

Elder Shen's expression revealed nothing of her thoughts. "The loss of the artifact is regrettable. The loss of a disciple, even one without cultivation potential, is a failure of leadership." Her gaze fixed on Feng Zhao. "You will meditate on this failure for thirty days in the Reflection Chamber. Perhaps isolation will improve your judgment."

Feng Zhao's composure slipped momentarily, shock and indignation flashing across his features before he mastered himself. "Yes, Elder. This disciple accepts correction."

The window's view faded, returning to its previous impossible landscape. Wei Liang stood motionless, absorbing what he had witnessed. The casual dismissal of his supposed death. The easy acceptance of Feng Zhao's lies. The concern for the artifact that outweighed any concern for a disciple's life.

"They are exactly as you remember them," the Hollow Woman observed. "Does this surprise you?"

"No," Wei Liang admitted. "But seeing it confirms what I already knew."

"And what will you do with this confirmation?"

Wei Liang turned away from the window, facing the darkness that was his unexpected guide. "Grow stronger. Master this path. And then return to show them exactly what they created when they left me to die."

The Hollow Woman's form shifted, darkness rippling with what might have been amusement or concern. "A predictable response. But not an unworthy one, provided you remember that revenge is merely a beginning, not an end."

"What comes after revenge?" Wei Liang asked.

"That," she said, "is the question that will determine whether you become merely another horror of the Wastes, or something truly transcendent." Her form moved toward the inverted door. "But such philosophical matters can wait. First, you must master the practical aspects of your transformation."

Wei Liang followed her outside, back into the Quiet Wastes where reality turned subtly inward. "You'll teach me?"

"I will show you what I can," she replied. "The rest, you must learn through experience. The Forgotten Path cannot be taught like traditional cultivation—it must be lived, suffered, embraced."

She led him to a small clearing where the inversion of reality was particularly strong. Here, spiritual energy flowed in reverse patterns, cycling inward rather than outward, collapsing rather than expanding.

"The Hollowborn stage focuses on absorption and concealment," she explained. "You must learn to control what you consume and how you appear to others. Begin by extending your awareness—feel the energy around you."

Wei Liang closed his eyes, reaching out with his new senses. The corrupted spiritual energy of the Wastes swirled around him, chaotic and potent. He could perceive it more clearly now than during his first days after transformation—distinct currents and eddies, each with different qualities and intensities.

"Good," the Hollow Woman said, observing him with senses he couldn't comprehend. "Now, draw some of that energy toward you—not all at once, but in a controlled stream. Imagine the emptiness within you as a vessel with a narrow opening, allowing only what you choose to enter."

Wei Liang focused on a nearby current of energy—one that felt less corrupted than others, closer to natural spiritual energy. He extended his awareness toward it, feeling the hunger within him respond eagerly. Too eagerly. The energy rushed toward him in a flood rather than a stream, threatening to overwhelm his control.

"Restraint," the Hollow Woman cautioned. "The Path will always hunger for more than you intend to take. You must impose your will upon it, not merely channel its power."

Wei Liang struggled, fighting to narrow the connection between himself and the energy current. Slowly, with great effort, he managed to reduce the flow to a manageable stream. The energy entered the emptiness within him, cool and potent, filling a small portion of the void.

"Better," she acknowledged. "Though still crude. With practice, you'll develop finer control."

They continued this exercise for hours, Wei Liang learning to select specific energy currents, to control the rate of absorption, to process different types of spiritual essence. The work was exhausting in a way physical training had never been—it taxed something deeper than muscles or breath, straining against the limits of his transformed being.

When they finally paused, the perpetual twilight of the Wastes had shifted toward deeper shadow, indicating the passage of time despite the absence of true night or day.

"You learn quickly," the Hollow Woman observed. "Most new to the Path struggle for weeks to achieve what you've managed in hours."

Wei Liang sensed this wasn't mere flattery. "Why?"

"Your previous emptiness prepared you," she said. "Those who come to the Path from traditional cultivation must unlearn before they can learn. You have less to unlearn."

A bitter irony—his greatest disadvantage in his previous life had become an advantage in his new existence. The absence of a spirit root, which had prevented him from gathering and circulating spiritual energy in the traditional manner, now allowed him to more easily adapt to a path that operated on opposite principles.

"What else must I learn?" he asked.

"Patience," she replied, amusement coloring her echoing voice. "Even the Forgotten Path requires time. But next, we should address concealment. The ability to hide your nature from those who would recognize it as anathema."

She led him to another area of the Quiet Wastes, where the boundary between corrupted and uncorrupted reality was more distinct. Here, normal spiritual energy occasionally flowed in from outside the Wastes, creating pockets of relative stability.

"Traditional cultivators sense others through their spiritual energy," the Hollow Woman explained. "They perceive the presence, strength, and nature of cultivation. What do you think they will sense when they encounter you?"

Wei Liang considered this. "Emptiness. Absence. A void where cultivation should be."

"Precisely. And nothing draws attention like an absence where something should exist." Her form shifted, darkness condensing until she appeared almost solid—a woman in gray robes, her features still indistinct but her form recognizably human. "The Hollowborn can conceal this emptiness, presenting a false front to spiritual senses."

She demonstrated, her presence in his spiritual perception changing from a void to something unremarkable—a minor cultivator of no particular strength or distinction. Someone easily overlooked, easily forgotten.

"How?" Wei Liang asked, fascinated by the transformation.

"By creating a shell of absorbed energy around your core emptiness," she explained, her form returning to its natural void state. "A thin layer that mimics normal cultivation, hiding the hunger beneath."

Wei Liang attempted to replicate the technique, drawing on the energy he had absorbed earlier. Shaping it proved difficult—like trying to form water into a specific shape with bare hands. His first attempts dissipated quickly, the energy either being consumed by his core emptiness or dispersing back into the environment.

"Intention is key," the Hollow Woman advised. "The energy responds to your will, but that will must be precise and sustained."

Wei Liang tried again, focusing more intently on the image he wished to project—a minor cultivator, unremarkable and unthreatening. This time, the energy responded better, forming a thin shell around his emptiness. It felt strange, like wearing a garment made of light, but it held.

"Now move," she instructed. "Maintain the shell while in motion."

This proved even more challenging. With each step, the energy shell threatened to collapse, requiring constant attention to maintain. Wei Liang persisted, gradually developing a divided awareness—one part focused inward on maintaining the disguise, another part engaged with the external world.

"This will become easier with practice," the Hollow Woman assured him. "Eventually, you'll maintain such concealment without conscious thought, as naturally as breathing."

They continued training until Wei Liang could maintain his false appearance while performing basic movements and interactions. By the end, exhaustion had settled deep into his being—not physical fatigue, but a spiritual depletion that made the hunger within him sharper, more demanding.

"Enough for today," the Hollow Woman decided, observing his state with her unseen eyes. "You need to rest and integrate what you've learned."

She led him back to the inverted cottage, where she indicated a space he could use for meditation. Wei Liang settled into a cross-legged position, closing his eyes and turning his awareness inward as he had done countless times in his previous life. The practice felt both familiar and utterly different now—where once he had found only frustration and limitation, now he found the controlled emptiness of his transformed core.

As he meditated, Wei Liang reflected on the day's training and the path that stretched before him. The Hollow Woman had shown him only the most basic techniques of the Hollowborn stage, yet even these exceeded anything he could have achieved as a rootless disciple. And beyond the Hollowborn lay further stages, each promising greater power at greater cost.

The hunger within him pulsed at these thoughts, eager for advancement, for consumption, for growth. Wei Liang acknowledged it without surrendering to it. Control, the Hollow Woman had emphasized. Restraint. Patience. The Path would always demand more than was wise to give.

His meditation deepened, consciousness expanding to encompass his transformed being more fully. He could sense the changes more precisely now—the crystalline structures forming within his flesh, the altered pathways where blood had once flowed, the hollow spaces where organs had been repurposed or rendered unnecessary. His body was becoming a vessel for something other than life as traditionally understood.

In this deepened awareness, Wei Liang also sensed something he hadn't noticed before—a subtle connection extending from his core emptiness outward, beyond his physical form. He followed this connection with his perception, tracing it through the corrupted reality of the Wastes, through layers of distortion and displacement, until he found its destination.

The array. Or what remained of it.

Though physically distant, the connection made it feel immediate, as if he could reach out and touch the destabilized formation. Through this link, he sensed that the array continued its collapse, reality around it fracturing further with each passing day. And at its center, where the node had been extracted, a wound in reality itself pulsed in rhythm with the emptiness inside him.

Wei Liang pulled his awareness back, disturbed by the implications. The node hadn't simply transformed him—it had connected him to the array, to the wound its removal had created. He was linked to the very source of the Wastes' corruption.

He opened his eyes, intending to ask the Hollow Woman about this discovery, but found the cottage empty. His mysterious guide had departed while he meditated, leaving him alone with his questions.

Outside, the perpetual twilight had shifted again, suggesting the passage of hours. Wei Liang emerged from the inverted structure, reorienting himself to the Quiet Wastes. His senses extended, searching for the Hollow Woman's distinctive void presence, but found nothing. She had gone beyond his perception's range.

Alone again. As he had always been, in truth, despite years surrounded by the sect's disciples and servants. The realization brought neither pain nor comfort—merely acknowledgment of a constant in his existence.

Wei Liang considered his options. He could wait for the Hollow Woman's return, assuming she intended to continue his training. Or he could explore further on his own, testing his new abilities and expanding his understanding of the Wastes.

The hunger within him suggested a third option—to seek out living cultivators, to consume their energy directly rather than absorbing ambient spiritual essence. The search party had departed, but others would come. The Azure Peaks Sect wouldn't abandon their interest in the Wastes entirely, not with valuable artifacts still potentially recoverable.

Wei Liang rejected this option for now. He was still too new to his powers, too uncertain of his control. Better to continue learning, to master what he had already gained before seeking more.

He decided to return to the crystal valley and the pavilion where he had first learned of the Forgotten Path. The inscriptions there might provide insight into the connection he had discovered during meditation.

Moving through the Quiet Wastes proved easier than before, his body adapting further to the inverted reality with each passing hour. He maintained the concealment technique the Hollow Woman had taught him, practicing the divided awareness necessary to sustain it while navigating the corrupted landscape.

As he traveled, Wei Liang encountered other denizens of the Wastes—creatures transformed by prolonged exposure to corruption, neither fully animal nor spirit but something between. They sensed his nature and gave him wide berth, recognizing a predator more dangerous than themselves.

One such creature, resembling a fox with too many tails and crystalline growths along its spine, actually bowed its head as he passed, a gesture of deference that would have been impossible for a normal animal. Wei Liang paused, studying the creature with his enhanced perception.

Its spiritual essence had been altered by the Wastes, developing a primitive consciousness beyond its original nature. Not cultivation in the traditional sense, but an adaptation to corruption that had granted it new awareness.

On impulse, Wei Liang reached out with his senses, not to consume but to communicate. The creature tensed initially, then relaxed as it recognized his intention. No words passed between them—the fox-thing lacked language as humans understood it—but impressions flowed: territory, safety, threats, resources.

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. The creature knew the Wastes in ways he did not—the safe paths, the dangerous zones, the places where reality broke down completely. Such knowledge could prove valuable.

He projected gratitude toward the fox-thing, then continued on his way, incorporating its territorial knowledge into his route. The interaction left him thoughtful. If even corrupted beasts could adapt and evolve in the Wastes, developing new forms of awareness, what possibilities might the Forgotten Path open for someone who approached it with intention rather than mere survival?

By the time Wei Liang reached the crystal valley, the twilight had deepened again, shadows stretching longer across the corrupted landscape. The crystalline pavilion stood as he had left it, its translucent walls glowing with inner light that responded to his approach.

He entered the structure, moving directly to the wall section that contained inscriptions about the Hollowborn stage. Reading them again with his expanded understanding, he found new meaning in passages that had seemed obscure before.

*The Hollowborn carries a fragment of the void within. This fragment seeks reunion with its source, creating a tether that transcends physical distance. Through this tether, influence flows both ways—the void shapes the vessel, and the vessel directs the void.*

The connection he had sensed during meditation. The inscriptions confirmed it was an expected aspect of his transformation, not an anomaly. But they also suggested something more concerning—that the influence between himself and the array was bidirectional. The void within him was changing him, yes, but his choices could also affect the wound in reality at the array's center.

Wei Liang continued reading, searching for more specific information about this connection and its implications. The inscriptions became more technical, describing energy patterns and void resonances in terms that stretched his comprehension despite his years of secret study.

One passage, however, stood out with disturbing clarity:

*As the vessel progresses along the Path, the tether strengthens. At the final threshold, vessel and void become indistinguishable. The Nameless emerges as both container and contained, capable of reshaping reality according to its nature. This is both the Path's ultimate promise and its greatest danger, for few vessels retain sufficient self to direct such power toward purpose rather than mere consumption.*

Wei Liang stepped back from the wall, absorbing the implications. The Forgotten Path didn't merely offer power as traditional cultivation did—it offered transformation into something beyond human, something capable of affecting reality itself. But at the cost of identity, of self, of purpose beyond hunger.

The Hollow Woman's warning made more sense now. Her caution about revenge being a beginning, not an end. Without a purpose beyond consumption and retribution, the Path would eventually consume the very self that sought power in the first place.

Wei Liang moved to the center of the pavilion, settling once more into meditation. This time, he deliberately explored the connection between himself and the array, not merely sensing it but testing its nature. He found that he could, with effort, send his awareness along this tether, perceiving the array site directly despite the physical distance separating them.

The array's collapse had continued in his absence. Reality fissures had multiplied, creating a maze of tears in the fabric of existence. The wound at the center pulsed with void energy, drawing in ambient spiritual essence and corrupting it. And around this wound, crystalline structures had begun to form—growths similar to those now developing within Wei Liang's transformed body.

The sight confirmed his suspicions. His transformation and the array's corruption were progressing in parallel, linked through the void fragment within him. What happened to one would affect the other.

Wei Liang withdrew his awareness, returning fully to the pavilion. The implications required careful consideration. If the connection grew stronger as he advanced along the Forgotten Path, would the array's corruption also intensify? Would his pursuit of power accelerate the Wastes' expansion? And if so, what responsibility did that place on him?

Such questions would have seemed absurd to the servant boy who had carried water for the Azure Peaks Sect, or even to the rootless disciple who had secretly studied cultivation techniques he could never perform. But to the Hollowborn he had become, they were unavoidable.

Before he could pursue these thoughts further, Wei Liang's enhanced senses detected movement at the valley's edge. Multiple presences approaching—human, cultivators, their spiritual energy bright and structured in his perception. Not a search party this time, but something more purposeful. More dangerous.

Wei Liang moved to the pavilion's entrance, extending his senses to their maximum range. Six cultivators, all at the Core Formation realm or higher. Their formation was tight and disciplined, designed for combat rather than search. And their spiritual energy carried a particular resonance he recognized from his studies—purification techniques, specifically developed to counter corruption.

Hunters. Specialists in cleansing Waste-touched entities and artifacts.

Wei Liang activated the concealment technique the Hollow Woman had taught him, creating a shell of absorbed energy around his core emptiness. But he suspected it wouldn't fool these cultivators for long—they were trained to detect precisely what he was trying to hide.

He had two options: flee deeper into the Wastes, or observe from hiding to learn more about these new threats. The hunger within him suggested a third option—attack, consume, grow stronger—but Wei Liang dismissed this as suicidal against such opponents.

Choosing observation, he moved from the pavilion to a nearby crystal formation that offered both concealment and a clear view of the approaching cultivators. From this vantage point, he could study their techniques and capabilities without exposing himself unnecessarily.

The hunters entered the valley in arrow formation, a white-robed cultivator at the point position. This leader held a jade compass that glowed with spiritual energy, its needle swinging in different directions as it detected corruption. The other five cultivators maintained a protective formation around him, their weapons drawn and glowing with purification energy.

Wei Liang recognized their robes—not Azure Peaks Sect, but the White Lotus Temple, specialists in purification cultivation who operated independently of the major sects. Their presence suggested the situation in the Wastes had escalated beyond a simple lost artifact. Something had drawn their attention specifically to this valley.

The leader paused, consulting his compass. "The corruption nexus is nearby," he announced, his voice carrying clearly in the crystalline environment. "Recent manifestation, but unusually potent. Possibly connected to the array destabilization."

One of the other cultivators, a woman with a silver sword, gestured toward the pavilion. "That structure isn't natural to the Wastes. It's too ordered, too purposeful."

The leader nodded. "A remnant from before the cataclysm, preserved in the corruption. The compass indicates it's a focal point for void energy."

They approached the pavilion cautiously, maintaining their protective formation. Wei Liang remained perfectly still, controlling even his breathing to minimize any detectable presence. The concealment technique strained under the pressure of proximity to such powerful cultivators, requiring constant adjustment to maintain.

The hunters entered the pavilion, their purification energy creating visible disturbance in the crystalline structure. Wei Liang could sense the conflict between their techniques and the ancient power embedded in the crystals—like oil and water refusing to mix.

"These inscriptions," the silver-sword woman said, examining the walls. "They describe a cultivation method. One I've never encountered in any orthodox text."

The leader approached the wall, his expression grave as he studied the ancient writing. "The Forgotten Path. One of the inverse methods from before the divine war. This shouldn't exist anymore—the Purification Conclave eradicated all records centuries ago."

"Yet here it stands," another hunter observed. "Preserved in the Wastes all this time."

The leader's face hardened. "And recently used. These energy signatures are fresh—someone has been here, reading these inscriptions, absorbing this knowledge."

Wei Liang tensed, preparing to flee if necessary. The hunters were too close to his position, their senses too acute. If they expanded their detection range even slightly, they would find him despite his concealment.

"Could it be connected to the Azure Peaks expedition?" the silver-sword woman asked. "They lost a disciple and an artifact in this region."

"Possible," the leader conceded. "Though a normal disciple couldn't interpret these inscriptions, let alone implement the techniques they describe."

"Unless they weren't normal," another hunter suggested. "The lost disciple was rootless, according to the report. No spirit root, no cultivation potential."

The leader's head snapped up, his expression changing from concern to alarm. "Rootless? You're certain?"

The hunter nodded. "That's what the Azure Peaks representative told the Conclave. A rootless disciple named Wei Liang, presumed dead after a confrontation with reality fissures."

"Heavens preserve us," the leader whispered, his face paling. "We need to report this immediately. If a rootless individual has found the Forgotten Path..."

He didn't finish the thought, but the other hunters' expressions reflected his alarm. They began a hasty examination of the pavilion, collecting energy samples and copying select inscriptions into jade slips for later study.

Wei Liang remained hidden, absorbing this unexpected information. The hunters feared the combination of rootlessness and the Forgotten Path specifically. Why? What made his particular condition so alarming to these specialists?

The inscriptions hadn't mentioned any special connection between rootlessness and the Path. The Hollow Woman hadn't indicated his lack of spirit root was significant beyond making adaptation easier. Yet these hunters, experts in their field, reacted with near panic to the possibility.

There was knowledge here he lacked, context he didn't possess. And that ignorance could prove dangerous.

The hunters completed their investigation of the pavilion and began a systematic search of the surrounding area. Their search pattern would bring them dangerously close to Wei Liang's hiding place within minutes. He needed to move, but any movement risked detection.

Drawing on the concealment technique, Wei Liang focused on projecting absolute stillness—not just physical immobility but spiritual quiescence. The emptiness within him, usually hungry and active, he temporarily compressed to its smallest possible state, reducing his detectable presence to nearly nothing.

The effort was enormous, like trying to compress water with bare hands. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite his transformed physiology, and the strain threatened to shatter his concentration. But he held, motionless and nearly undetectable, as the hunters passed within feet of his position.

The silver-sword woman paused, frowning, her senses clearly detecting something amiss. She turned slowly, gaze passing over Wei Liang's hiding place without focusing on him specifically.

"Something's here," she said quietly. "But it's... strange. Like looking at a shadow from the corner of your eye."

The leader joined her, his jade compass extended. The needle swung erratically, unable to fix on Wei Liang's compressed emptiness. "The corruption makes detection unreliable. We'll need to perform a purification sweep of the entire valley before we can be certain."

They moved away, rejoining the other hunters who had completed their search of the immediate area. Wei Liang remained frozen, maintaining his compressed state despite the mounting strain. Only when the hunters had moved to the valley's far side did he dare release the technique, his emptiness expanding back to its normal state with an almost audible snap.

The hunger surged back immediately, intensified by the effort of compression. Wei Liang fought it down, focusing on the immediate need to escape before the hunters began their purification sweep. Such techniques would likely cause him significant harm in his current state, perhaps even reverse his transformation entirely.

Moving with preternatural silence, Wei Liang slipped from his hiding place and made his way toward the valley's edge opposite from the hunters' position. His enhanced senses remained fixed on their location, tracking their movements and energy fluctuations to time his own retreat.

He had nearly reached the boundary when a sound stopped him—a crystalline chime that resonated through the valley. The hunters reacted immediately, their formation tightening as they turned toward the source.

The Hollow Woman stood atop the pavilion, her darkness stark against the crystalline structure. She made no attempt at concealment, her void nature fully visible to the hunters' specialized senses.

"The White Lotus Temple sends its dogs into my territory," she said, her echoing voice carrying clearly. "How nostalgic. It's been, what, seventy years since your last failed attempt to 'purify' me?"

The leader stepped forward, jade compass raised defensively. "The Hollow Woman. We thought you had finally faded."

"Disappointed?" Her form shifted, darkness flowing like liquid. "I endure, as does the truth your Conclave tries so desperately to erase."

The hunters spread out, clearly preparing for combat. The silver-sword woman's blade began to glow with intensified purification energy. "You've violated the Containment Accord by accessing the crystal pavilion. The corrupted knowledge within was sealed for good reason."

The Hollow Woman's laugh echoed unnaturally. "I violated nothing. The pavilion opened itself to one who could read its wisdom. I merely observed, as is my right in these Wastes."

"Where is the rootless one?" the leader demanded. "We know he survived. We know he's been here."

"Do you?" Her form expanded, darkness spreading outward like wings. "Then you know more than I. Perhaps you should continue your search... elsewhere."

With these words, she gestured sharply. The crystals throughout the valley responded, vibrating at increasing frequency until they emitted a sound that pierced through Wei Liang's enhanced senses like physical pain. The hunters clutched their heads, their formation breaking as the sound disrupted their concentration.

The Hollow Woman flowed from the pavilion's top directly toward Wei Liang's position, moving faster than seemed possible. As she reached him, her darkness enveloped him completely, and the world shifted around them.

When the darkness receded, they stood in a different part of the Wastes entirely—a region where reality seemed more stable, the corruption less obvious but more deeply ingrained. The crystal valley was nowhere in sight.

"Displacement technique," the Hollow Woman explained, her form settling back into its usual state. "Useful for avoiding unwanted attention."

Wei Liang steadied himself, the sudden transition having disoriented his senses. "You came back."

"Obviously." Her tone suggested this shouldn't have been surprising. "The White Lotus hunters are dangerous, especially to one newly walking the Path. Their purification techniques could have reverted your transformation, returned you to your rootless state."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with a chill. To lose what he had gained, to return to powerlessness after tasting its opposite—the thought was more terrifying than any threat of death.

"Thank you," he said simply.

The Hollow Woman's form shifted in what might have been a shrug. "Self-interest, nothing more. A new disciple of the Path is rare enough to be worth preserving, at least until I determine whether you're more useful or dangerous."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment without offense. In the Wastes, as in the cultivation world, power and utility determined one's treatment. At least the Hollow Woman was honest about her calculations.

"The hunters knew about me specifically," he said. "They feared the combination of rootlessness and the Forgotten Path. Why?"

The darkness of her form seemed to deepen, becoming more absolute. "Because rootless individuals who walk the Path have unique... potential. Traditional cultivators are limited by their spirit roots—their nature is fixed from birth, their path predetermined. Even when they find the Forgotten Path, this limitation remains, constraining what they can become."

She moved closer, her void presence cool against his senses. "But the rootless have no such constraint. No predetermined nature. You are empty vessels from the beginning, capable of being filled with... anything."

Wei Liang considered this. "The inscriptions mentioned the Nameless—the final stage where vessel and void become indistinguishable."

"Yes." Her voice grew softer, more distant. "For most who walk the Path, the Nameless is a metaphor—they become something other than human, but still limited by their original nature. For the rootless, however..."

She didn't finish the thought, but Wei Liang understood the implication. Without a spirit root to define his fundamental nature, his transformation had fewer boundaries, fewer limitations. The emptiness that had been his greatest weakness now offered potential beyond what normal cultivators could achieve—even those who found the Forgotten Path.

"Is that why you're helping me?" he asked. "To see what I might become?"

"Curiosity is one of the few pleasures remaining to me after centuries of existence," she admitted. "And yes, I wish to see if you can avoid the fate of the last rootless one who walked this path."

"What happened to them?"

The Hollow Woman was silent for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice held an emotion Wei Liang couldn't identify—something between regret and fear.

"He became something even the Wastes couldn't contain. Something that required the combined might of every major sect to seal away." Her form contracted slightly, darkness condensing. "The cataclysm that created these Wastes? It wasn't just the forgotten gods fighting among themselves. It was also their attempt to contain what one rootless cultivator became after reaching the Nameless stage."

Wei Liang stared at her, the implications staggering. "A single cultivator caused... this?" He gestured at the broken reality around them.

"Not caused. Necessitated." She turned away, her form flowing rather than stepping. "Come. We should put more distance between ourselves and the hunters before continuing your training. They'll track us eventually—White Lotus specialists are persistent—but we can delay that reckoning."

As they moved through the more stable region of the Wastes, Wei Liang processed what he had learned. The Forgotten Path offered him power beyond what he had imagined, but at risks equally beyond his initial understanding. The hunters' fear made more sense now—they weren't merely concerned about corruption, but about the possibility of history repeating itself.

"If the rootless have such potential on this path," he asked as they traveled, "why aren't we hunted to extinction? Why allow any of us to live at all?"

"Because you're exceedingly rare," the Hollow Woman replied. "And because most rootless individuals never discover their potential. They live and die as servants, laborers, beggars—invisible to the cultivation world except as occasional tools. The sects consider it simpler to ignore you than to systematically eliminate you."

She paused, her form turning toward him. "Though some sects do quietly dispose of rootless children born within their territories. A precaution against precisely what you're becoming."

The casual mention of such atrocity didn't surprise Wei Liang. The cultivation world's brutality toward those deemed worthless was something he had experienced firsthand. That it extended to infanticide was merely the logical conclusion of a system built on power as the sole measure of value.

"And the Azure Peaks Sect?" he asked. "They kept me despite knowing I was rootless."

"An interesting question." The Hollow Woman resumed moving. "Perhaps they're more enlightened than most. Or perhaps they had other reasons for keeping you close. Reasons worth investigating, once you've grown stronger."

They continued in silence after that, Wei Liang contemplating the implications of his new knowledge while remaining alert for signs of pursuit. The Hollow Woman led him through increasingly unfamiliar territory—regions of the Wastes where corruption manifested in subtle, almost beautiful ways. Flowers that bloomed with geometric perfection. Streams that flowed in perfect circles. Birds whose songs created visible patterns in the air.

Eventually they reached a clearing where a single massive tree stood, its trunk and branches formed from what appeared to be jade rather than wood. Its leaves were thin slices of crystal that chimed softly in the perpetual twilight breeze.

"We'll rest here," the Hollow Woman said. "The Tree of Resonance masks spiritual signatures. Even White Lotus hunters will struggle to detect us in its vicinity."

Wei Liang approached the tree with cautious fascination. His enhanced senses perceived complex energy patterns flowing through its jade-like structure—not corruption exactly, but a different form of power altogether.

"What is it?" he asked.

"A remnant, like the pavilion. A living artifact from before the cataclysm." She settled at the tree's base, her darkness seeming to blend with the shadows cast by its crystalline canopy. "It grows at the boundary between corrupted and uncorrupted reality, drawing sustenance from both."

Wei Liang sat across from her, his back against the jade trunk. The contact sent a pleasant vibration through his transformed body, a resonance that seemed to stabilize the emptiness within him, making the hunger temporarily less insistent.

"You've learned much today," the Hollow Woman observed. "Perhaps too much, too quickly. The Path is not meant to be rushed."

"I don't have the luxury of time," Wei Liang replied. "The hunters know about me now. They'll report to their Conclave, which will inform the major sects. The Azure Peaks will realize I survived, that I've changed. They'll send more than search parties next time."

"True." Her form shifted, darkness flowing into a more defined shape—almost human in outline, though still featureless. "But power sought in haste is often power misused. The Forgotten Path punishes impatience more severely than most cultivation methods."

Wei Liang acknowledged the warning with a nod. "Then teach me patience along with power. Show me how to progress without losing myself to the hunger."

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely, an unusual state for her constantly shifting darkness. "An interesting request. Most who find the Path care only for advancement, for consumption, for power. Few consider the preservation of self a priority."

"I didn't survive this long by valuing power over survival," Wei Liang said. "And what use is vengeance if I'm not myself to witness it?"

A sound emerged from her darkness—something between a laugh and a sigh. "Perhaps you are different from those who came before. Very well. I will teach you what I know of balancing progression with preservation. But understand this: the Path will always demand sacrifice. The only choice is what you sacrifice, not whether you sacrifice."

Wei Liang accepted this with the pragmatism that had defined his existence. Nothing in life came without cost—this had been true when he was a servant, true when he was a rootless disciple, and remained true now that he walked the Forgotten Path. The difference was that now, for the first time, he could choose which prices he was willing to pay.

As the crystalline leaves chimed softly overhead, the Hollow Woman began her instruction—not in techniques of power, but in methods of retention. Ways to preserve memory despite the Path's erosion. Means of anchoring identity against the pull of the void. Approaches to feeding the hunger without being consumed by it.

Wei Liang absorbed these lessons with the same dedicated focus he had once applied to studying cultivation manuals he could never implement. But now, as the Hollowborn, each lesson could be immediately tested, immediately applied. His transformed nature responded to these teachings, the emptiness within him becoming more defined, more controlled, more purposeful.

In the distance, beyond perception but drawing inevitably closer, the White Lotus hunters continued their search. The Azure Peaks Sect continued its calculations. The cultivation world continued its rigid adherence to hierarchy and power.

And in the shadow of the jade tree, Wei Liang—once rootless, now Hollowborn—continued his transformation into something the cultivation world had not seen in centuries. Something they had good reason to fear.

Something that remembered.



# Chapter 6: First Hunt

The White Lotus hunters had not given up.

Wei Liang sensed them before he saw them—six points of purifying light moving through the corrupted landscape of the Wastes like surgical knives through infected flesh. Their spiritual energy carried that distinctive resonance of purification techniques, designed to excise corruption rather than merely resist it.

Seven days had passed since his encounter with them at the crystal pavilion. Seven days of intensive training under the Hollow Woman's guidance. Seven days of growing stronger, more controlled, more deliberate in his use of the Forgotten Path's techniques.

He watched the hunters from the high ridge overlooking what the Hollow Woman called the Quiet Wastes. From this distance, they couldn't detect him, especially with the concealment technique he had now mastered. His emptiness remained hidden behind a shell of absorbed energy, presenting the spiritual signature of ordinary rock and soil rather than the void that would draw their attention.

"They're persistent," he observed as the Hollow Woman flowed up beside him, her darkness stark against the perpetual twilight.

"The White Lotus Temple trains its hunters to pursue corruption with religious fervor," she replied. "They believe the Wastes are a spiritual infection that must be contained and eventually cleansed. Your existence represents a particular threat to their worldview."

Wei Liang studied the hunters' formation. They moved differently now—more cautiously, more systematically. They had adapted their approach after their failure at the crystal pavilion.

"They're tracking us," he said. "Not just searching randomly."

"Yes." The Hollow Woman's form shifted, darkness rippling with what might have been concern. "They've likely obtained something connected to you—perhaps from the Azure Peaks Sect, or from the array site. With such a focus, their tracking techniques can pierce even the Wastes' distortions."

Wei Liang considered this. "How long before they find us?"

"Days, perhaps. Hours if we're careless." Her form contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "Which makes this an opportune moment for your next lesson."

Wei Liang turned toward her, curiosity overriding his concern about the hunters. Each lesson she had taught him had expanded his understanding of the Forgotten Path and his own transformed nature. Each had made him stronger, more capable, more comfortable in his new existence.

"What lesson?" he asked.

"Consumption," she said simply. "Direct absorption of cultivated spiritual energy."

The hunger within Wei Liang responded immediately to these words, the emptiness at his core pulsing with anticipation. Until now, he had fed it only ambient energy from the Wastes—corrupted essence that satisfied the immediate need but provided little substantial growth. The thought of consuming pure, cultivated energy directly from its source sent a shiver of both desire and apprehension through him.

"From them?" He gestured toward the distant hunters.

"No." The Hollow Woman's tone carried a sharp edge. "The White Lotus hunters are beyond your current capabilities. Their purification techniques would likely destroy you if you attempted direct consumption."

She flowed away from the ridge's edge, indicating for him to follow. "There are others in the Wastes—less dangerous prey for your first hunt."

Wei Liang followed her down the ridge's far side, away from the hunters' path. As they descended, she continued her instruction.

"The Hollowborn can consume spiritual energy in three ways," she explained. "Ambient absorption, which you've already practiced. Direct consumption from willing or unconscious sources. And forcible extraction from resistant cultivators."

They reached the base of the ridge, entering a region where the corruption manifested as subtle distortions of natural growth—trees that curved at impossible angles, grass that grew in perfect geometric patterns.

"Each method has its advantages and limitations," the Hollow Woman continued. "Ambient absorption is safest but provides minimal growth. Willing donation is efficient but rare—few cultivators would voluntarily feed the Forgotten Path. Forcible extraction provides the most substantial power but carries the greatest risk, both physical and spiritual."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with his usual focused attention. "Risk beyond the obvious?"

"Yes." Her darkness seemed to deepen. "When you forcibly consume another's cultivated energy, you don't just take their power—you take fragments of their nature, their memories, their essence. These fragments can influence your own development if you're not careful to process them properly."

This explained something Wei Liang had wondered about—why those who walked the Forgotten Path were said to lose themselves as they progressed. It wasn't just the void's influence eroding identity, but the accumulated fragments of consumed cultivators altering the consumer's nature.

"How do I process these fragments properly?" he asked.

"By maintaining clear intention," she replied. "By knowing what you wish to preserve of yourself and what you're willing to discard. By consuming with purpose rather than mere hunger."

They continued through the geometrically corrupted landscape until they reached a small valley where a stream flowed in a perfect spiral pattern. Near its center stood a simple shelter constructed from materials that didn't belong in the Wastes—ordinary wood and stone rather than the crystalline or corrupted substances that dominated the region.

"Scavengers," the Hollow Woman explained, gesturing toward the shelter. "Cultivators who enter the Wastes to collect corrupted materials for sale to alchemists and artifact crafters. They operate in the boundary regions where corruption is mild enough to permit extended stays without protection."

Wei Liang extended his senses toward the shelter. Three cultivators inside—all at the Foundation Establishment realm, their spiritual energy modest but well-structured. Not sect disciples but independent practitioners, judging by the unaligned nature of their cultivation.

"Why haven't the White Lotus hunters found them?" he asked.

"The hunters focus on corruption threats, not minor scavenging operations," she replied. "These cultivators are careful to avoid deeper corruption and take only what can be safely transported out of the Wastes. They represent no threat to the containment of the Wastes' influence."

Wei Liang studied the scavengers' spiritual signatures more carefully. Their energy patterns were stable but showed signs of prolonged exposure to mild corruption—small distortions that wouldn't be noticeable outside the Wastes but were clear to his enhanced perception.

"They're already partially corrupted," he observed.

"Yes. It makes them suitable prey for your first consumption." The Hollow Woman's form settled into stillness. "Their energy will be easier to process than that of pure cultivators, and the cultivation world will not miss them should you... miscalculate."

The cold pragmatism of her assessment didn't disturb Wei Liang. His years at the Azure Peaks Sect had taught him that the cultivation world assigned value to individuals based solely on their power and connections. These independent scavengers, operating in the margins of society, would indeed go unmissed if they disappeared.

"How should I approach them?" he asked, already analyzing potential strategies.

"Directly," she said, surprising him. "Present yourself as a lost disciple. Their greed will do the rest."

Wei Liang considered this approach. It had merit—scavengers would see a lone disciple as an opportunity rather than a threat. They might attempt to rob him, or perhaps offer false assistance while leading him into a trap. Either way, it would bring them close enough for him to act.

"And when they're close enough?" he asked.

"You'll know," she replied, her voice carrying a hint of something like anticipation. "The hunger will guide you. Just remember—maintain your intention throughout. Consume with purpose, not merely appetite."

With these final instructions, the Hollow Woman flowed backward, her darkness merging with the shadows at the valley's edge. "I will observe, but not intervene unless absolutely necessary. This hunt is yours to complete or fail."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting both the responsibility and the implicit test. He adjusted his concealment technique, modifying the shell of energy around his core emptiness to present not as natural elements but as a cultivator in distress—spiritual energy fluctuating in patterns that suggested injury and exhaustion.

He tore his outer robe strategically, adding physical evidence to support his deception. A smear of soil across his face, a slight limp to his gait, and his disguise was complete—a sect disciple separated from his companions, lost and vulnerable in the Wastes.

Wei Liang approached the scavengers' shelter from the most visible direction, making no attempt to hide his presence. He allowed his footsteps to be heard, his labored breathing to carry on the still air. The performance wasn't entirely feigned—maintaining the specific energy shell required concentration, especially while in motion.

The shelter's door opened before he reached it. A man emerged—middle-aged, weather-worn, with the calloused hands and wary eyes of someone who lived by his wits in dangerous territory. His cultivation aura identified him as the strongest of the three inside, though still only at mid-Foundation Establishment.

"Ho there," the man called, one hand resting casually on the sword at his hip. "You're a long way from anywhere safe, young cultivator."

Wei Liang stopped a respectful distance away, swaying slightly as if struggling to remain upright. "Thank the heavens," he gasped. "I thought I might die out here. My sect brothers and I were separated during a reality fissure event. I've been wandering for days."

The man's eyes narrowed slightly, assessing Wei Liang with the practiced gaze of someone accustomed to evaluating both threats and opportunities. "Which sect?" he asked.

"Azure Peaks," Wei Liang replied, choosing the truth as the most convincing lie. He gestured at his torn robe, where the sect's cloud pattern remained visible despite the damage.

The man relaxed slightly, apparently finding the story plausible. "Feng Hu," he introduced himself with a shallow bow. "These are my Wastes-walking companions, Mei and Tao." He gestured toward the shelter, where a woman and another man now stood watching from the doorway.

"Wei Liang," he replied, using his real name without concern. If he succeeded in what he planned, there would be no one to report his survival anyway.

"Come inside," Feng Hu offered, stepping aside. "We have water and some food. You can rest before continuing your search."

Wei Liang bowed gratefully and limped toward the shelter. As he passed Feng Hu, he sensed the man's spiritual energy more clearly—decades of careful cultivation, structured and disciplined despite his rough appearance. A substantial meal for the emptiness within him.

The shelter's interior was simple but well-organized. Maps of the Wastes' boundary regions covered one wall, marked with locations of valuable materials and dangerous corruption zones. Storage containers lined another wall, presumably holding their scavenged items. A small cooking area occupied the center, where a pot of something aromatic simmered over a spirit-stone heating array.

"Sit," the woman, Mei, instructed, gesturing toward a simple bench. Her cultivation was the weakest of the three, but her spiritual energy had an unusual quality—flexible and adaptive rather than rigidly structured. "You look half-dead."

Wei Liang accepted the seat with murmured thanks. The third scavenger, Tao, handed him a cup of water, which he sipped slowly, maintaining his facade of exhaustion while observing the three with his enhanced senses.

They were cautious but not immediately hostile. Their spiritual energy remained in a neutral state—neither gathered for attack nor completely relaxed. Experienced survivors, then, neither trusting nor overtly suspicious.

"What brought Azure Peaks disciples so deep into the Wastes?" Feng Hu asked, seating himself across from Wei Liang. "You're a bit beyond your sect's usual territory."

"A recovery mission," Wei Liang replied, mixing truth and falsehood. "An artifact was detected in the inner regions. Our team was sent to retrieve it."

The three scavengers exchanged glances that confirmed Wei Liang's assessment of their nature. The mention of an artifact had sparked immediate interest—and calculation.

"Valuable artifact?" Tao asked, trying to sound casual and failing.

Wei Liang allowed a hint of sect disciple arrogance to color his response. "Valuable enough for Elder Shen to send a full team of inner disciples." He paused, then added with apparent reluctance, "And now it's lost, along with my sect brothers. Elder Shen will have my cultivation crippled for this failure."

Another exchange of glances between the scavengers. Wei Liang could practically see their thoughts—a desperate disciple, a valuable artifact, and the possibility of profit from both.

"Perhaps we could help you find your sect brothers," Feng Hu suggested, his tone carefully neutral despite the greed Wei Liang could sense in his spiritual fluctuations. "We know these regions better than most. For a reasonable finder's fee, of course."

"I have nothing to offer," Wei Liang said, injecting desperation into his voice. "Everything I carried was lost when we were separated."

Mei leaned forward, her expression sympathetic but her eyes calculating. "Your sect would surely reward those who helped return one of their disciples safely, wouldn't they? Especially if we could help locate this artifact as well."

Wei Liang pretended to consider this, as if weighing his limited options. "I... suppose they would. Elder Shen is strict but fair. If you could help me find either my sect brothers or the artifact, I'm certain she would compensate you appropriately."

Feng Hu nodded, apparently satisfied with this arrangement. "Rest tonight. Tomorrow we'll begin searching. The Wastes are dangerous to traverse without proper knowledge."

"Thank you," Wei Liang said, bowing his head in apparent gratitude. "I won't forget this kindness."

The scavengers relaxed further, their greed overriding whatever caution they might normally exercise. They began discussing search patterns and territory divisions, already planning how to maximize their chances of finding either the fictional sect brothers or the valuable artifact.

Wei Liang maintained his disguise throughout the evening, accepting a bowl of the simmering stew and listening to the scavengers' stories of their finds in the Wastes. He learned useful information about the boundary regions and the patterns of corruption, filing it away for future reference.

As night fell—or what passed for night in the perpetual twilight of the Wastes—the scavengers prepared for sleep. They arranged simple bedrolls around the shelter's perimeter, positioning Wei Liang nearest the door in a show of hospitality that was likely meant to prevent him from accessing their stored scavenged materials.

"Rest well," Feng Hu said as he settled onto his own bedroll. "Tomorrow will require strength and focus."

Wei Liang nodded, lying down and feigning immediate exhaustion. He regulated his breathing to mimic sleep while maintaining complete awareness through his enhanced senses. The scavengers remained awake for some time, conversing in whispers they thought too quiet for him to hear.

"...could ransom him back to the sect," Tao suggested.

"Fool," Mei hissed. "Azure Peaks doesn't negotiate with scavengers. They'd send cultivators to retrieve him and punish us."

"The artifact is the real prize," Feng Hu decided. "We help him search, but we find it first. Then we can decide whether to return him or not."

Wei Liang listened to their plotting with cold amusement. Their petty schemes seemed almost childish compared to the fate he had planned for them. They saw him as a resource to be exploited; he saw them as sustenance to be consumed.

He waited patiently until their whispers ceased and their breathing deepened into genuine sleep. Their spiritual energy settled into the distinctive patterns of unconsciousness—still present but less structured, more vulnerable.

Wei Liang rose silently, his transformed body moving without sound across the shelter's floor. He positioned himself at the center of the triangle formed by the three sleeping scavengers, equidistant from each. Then he released the concealment technique, allowing his true nature to emerge.

The emptiness within him expanded, no longer constrained by the shell of false energy. The hunger, held in check for hours, surged forward with almost painful intensity. Wei Liang controlled it with effort, remembering the Hollow Woman's warning—consume with purpose, not merely appetite.

He focused on his intention: to absorb these cultivators' energy without taking on their nature, to grow stronger without being influenced by their essence. With this purpose firmly in mind, he extended his awareness toward the closest scavenger—Mei.

Her spiritual energy responded to his attention, fluctuating slightly even in sleep. Wei Liang reached out not with physical touch but with the emptiness itself, extending tendrils of void toward her cultivation core. The contact was delicate, almost gentle—not forcible extraction yet, but preparation for it.

Mei stirred, her subconscious sensing the intrusion despite her unconscious state. Wei Liang paused, waiting for her to settle again before continuing. When her breathing returned to its deep rhythm, he resumed his approach, void tendrils penetrating deeper toward her spiritual center.

The hunger urged him to rush, to devour her energy in one violent consumption. Wei Liang resisted, maintaining the slow, methodical approach the Hollow Woman had described during his training. Rushing would not only wake the scavengers but would make processing their energy more difficult.

When the void tendrils finally reached Mei's cultivation core, Wei Liang felt a moment of connection—a bridge between his emptiness and her energy. Through this connection, he sensed fragments of her essence: ambition tempered by pragmatism, greed balanced by survival instinct, loyalty to her companions born of necessity rather than affection.

With careful precision, Wei Liang began to draw her spiritual energy across the connection. Not in a rush, but in a steady flow—like drinking from a cup rather than upending it. The energy entered his emptiness, cool and substantial, more satisfying than the ambient corruption he had absorbed previously.

Mei's body tensed, her face contorting in discomfort though she remained asleep. Her spiritual energy resisted instinctively, trying to maintain its integrity against the drain. Wei Liang increased the pull slightly, overcoming this unconscious resistance without waking her.

As her energy flowed into him, Wei Liang processed it according to the Hollow Woman's instructions—separating pure power from the fragments of personality and memory that accompanied it. The power he directed into his core emptiness, allowing it to strengthen his transformed being. The fragments he examined briefly before discarding most, retaining only practical knowledge about the Wastes and cultivation techniques he found useful.

Mei's breathing grew labored as the drain continued. Her spiritual energy diminished steadily, her cultivation base eroding under Wei Liang's careful consumption. He monitored her condition closely, aware that taking too much would kill her rather than merely weaken her. Death would complicate his plan for the other two.

When he had consumed approximately half her spiritual energy—enough to significantly strengthen himself without immediately endangering her life—Wei Liang withdrew the void tendrils. The connection severed, leaving Mei pale and sweating but alive. Her cultivation had been reduced from early Foundation Establishment to something barely above mortal levels.

Without pausing to savor this first successful consumption, Wei Liang turned his attention to Tao. The process was repeated—the careful approach, the connection, the steady drain of energy. Tao's essence carried different fragments: resentment toward the major sects, pride in his independence, fear of the deeper Wastes. Wei Liang processed these as he had Mei's, discarding most while absorbing the pure energy into his emptiness.

By the time he finished with Tao, Wei Liang could feel the changes in his transformed body. The emptiness within him felt more substantial somehow, more defined. The crystalline structures that had begun forming throughout his flesh grew more pronounced, more complex. His senses sharpened further, allowing him to perceive spiritual energy with greater precision.

He turned finally to Feng Hu, the strongest of the three and therefore the most valuable source. As Wei Liang extended his void tendrils toward the man's cultivation core, he felt resistance even before making contact—Feng Hu's spiritual energy was better protected, more disciplined even in sleep.

Wei Liang adjusted his approach, making the tendrils thinner, more subtle, less detectable to spiritual senses. It took longer to establish the connection, requiring more precision and control, but eventually he succeeded. Feng Hu's essence revealed decades of hard-won cultivation, bitter experiences that had shaped both his techniques and his character, knowledge of the Wastes that exceeded his companions'.

The consumption process began as before, with Wei Liang drawing Feng Hu's spiritual energy in a steady, controlled flow. The man's cultivation resisted more strongly than the others', his spiritual foundations more firmly established through years of practice. Wei Liang increased the pull gradually, overcoming this resistance without triggering defensive reflexes that might wake him.

As Feng Hu's energy flowed into him, Wei Liang felt the hunger growing more insistent, demanding complete consumption rather than partial feeding. The emptiness within him, partially filled by Mei and Tao's energy, now wanted to devour Feng Hu entirely—to take not just his power but his very essence.

Wei Liang struggled to maintain his original intention. Consume with purpose, not appetite. Take what strengthens without changing your nature. He repeated these principles mentally while continuing the careful drain of Feng Hu's cultivation.

The scavenger's breathing grew increasingly labored, his face contorting in pain despite remaining unconscious. His spiritual energy fought harder against the drain as it diminished, instinctive survival mechanisms activating even without conscious direction.

Wei Liang had consumed perhaps two-thirds of Feng Hu's cultivation when the man's eyes snapped open, awareness returning despite the spiritual drain. For a moment, confusion dominated his expression—then horror as he perceived Wei Liang's true nature through spiritual senses.

"Waste-fiend!" Feng Hu gasped, his hand moving toward the sword beside his bedroll. "Corruption incarnate!"

Wei Liang didn't bother correcting this misidentification. Instead, he intensified the connection, shifting from careful consumption to forcible extraction. The void tendrils thickened, pulling Feng Hu's remaining spiritual energy in a torrent rather than a stream.

The scavenger tried to resist, attempting to gather his diminished power for a defensive technique. But with most of his cultivation already consumed, his efforts were futile. His spiritual energy continued flowing into Wei Liang's emptiness, now accompanied by fragments of conscious thought and immediate emotion—fear, rage, disbelief.

These conscious fragments were harder to process, carrying stronger imprints of Feng Hu's identity. Wei Liang struggled to separate power from essence, to consume one without absorbing the other. Some fragments slipped through his filtering, briefly imposing foreign thoughts and emotions on his consciousness before he could isolate and discard them.

Feng Hu's hand closed around his sword hilt, but he lacked the strength to draw the weapon. His cultivation nearly depleted, his physical body began to fail as well—systems dependent on spiritual energy shutting down one by one.

"What... are you?" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Wei Liang met his gaze directly, allowing the scavenger to see what he had become. "The consequence of abandonment," he replied, his voice carrying the faint echo that had developed since his transformation. "The price of betrayal."

Feng Hu's eyes widened in final understanding before the last of his spiritual energy flowed into Wei Liang's emptiness. Without cultivation to sustain his aging body, the scavenger collapsed, dead before he hit the ground.

The sudden death sent a pulse of energy through the shelter—not spiritual but something more primal, the release that accompanies a soul's departure from its vessel. This pulse disturbed the remaining scavengers' sleep, drawing them toward consciousness despite their weakened state.

Wei Liang turned toward Mei as her eyes fluttered open. Her spiritual senses, diminished but not entirely gone, registered his true nature immediately. Unlike Feng Hu, however, her reaction wasn't horror but despair—the recognition that escape was impossible.

"Please," she whispered, too weak to move from her bedroll. "Mercy."

Wei Liang considered her request dispassionately. The hunger within him was partially sated by the three consumptions, no longer demanding immediate feeding. He could spare her life without compromising his growth. The question was whether doing so served his purpose.

"What would you do with mercy if granted it?" he asked, curious despite himself.

Mei swallowed, her gaze darting to Feng Hu's lifeless form before returning to Wei Liang. "Live," she said simply. "Continue. Survive."

An honest answer, at least. No promises of redemption or change, just the basic drive to exist that had likely guided her entire life. Wei Liang respected the simplicity of it, the absence of pretense.

"Then survive," he decided, stepping away from her. "Return to the cultivation world. Tell them what you encountered in the Wastes. Describe what I've become."

Relief flooded her face, quickly followed by confusion. "You want me to warn them about you?"

"I want them to know I'm coming," Wei Liang clarified. "I want them to prepare, to gather their strength, to believe they can stop what approaches. It will make their failure more complete when it comes."

Understanding dawned in Mei's eyes, followed by a fear deeper than her earlier despair. Not fear for herself, but for the cultivation world that remained ignorant of what had awakened in the Wastes.

"Who should I tell?" she asked, her voice steadier now that immediate death no longer threatened.

"The Azure Peaks Sect," Wei Liang replied. "Tell them Wei Liang has found a new path. Tell them he remembers their betrayal. Tell them he's coming home."

Tao stirred on his bedroll, consciousness returning more slowly due to his weaker constitution. Wei Liang glanced at him briefly before returning his attention to Mei.

"Take him with you," he instructed. "Two witnesses are more convincing than one. Leave now, before I reconsider my mercy."

Mei didn't need to be told twice. Despite her weakened state, she rose shakily and moved to Tao, helping him to his feet. They gathered nothing from the shelter, abandoning their scavenged materials and supplies in their haste to escape.

At the door, Mei paused, looking back at Wei Liang with an expression he couldn't quite interpret. "What are you becoming?" she asked, the question seeming driven by genuine curiosity rather than fear.

Wei Liang considered his answer carefully. "Something forgotten," he finally said. "Something the cultivation world tried to erase from memory. Something returning to remind them of what they abandoned."

Mei nodded slowly, as if his cryptic answer confirmed some private thought. Without another word, she and Tao departed, supporting each other as they stumbled away from the shelter and the horror it contained.

Wei Liang watched them go, tracking their spiritual signatures until they passed beyond even his enhanced perception. Only then did he turn his attention inward, examining the changes wrought by his first true feeding.

The emptiness within him had evolved, developing structure within its void. The hunger remained but felt different—more focused, more patient, more purposeful. His physical form had changed as well, the crystalline alterations spreading further throughout his flesh, replacing more of his original humanity with something other.

He extended his awareness outward, testing the limits of his enhanced perception. His range had increased significantly, allowing him to sense spiritual energy at greater distances and with finer discrimination. He could detect the White Lotus hunters from his current position, still following their methodical search pattern several miles away.

"An efficient first hunt," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing through the shelter's door without opening it. "Though perhaps more merciful than I expected."

Wei Liang turned toward her, unsurprised by her sudden appearance. He had sensed her watching throughout the consumption process, her void presence distinct even when she attempted to conceal it.

"Mercy serves my purpose," he replied. "Their warnings will create anticipation, expectation. The cultivation world will prepare for a threat they think they understand."

"And they will face one beyond their comprehension," she concluded, her form shifting as she examined him. "You've changed more than I anticipated from a single feeding. The rootless truly do progress differently along this path."

Wei Liang moved to the shelter's center, where Feng Hu's body lay. The scavenger's face remained frozen in that final moment of understanding, eyes wide, mouth slightly open. Wei Liang closed those staring eyes with a gesture that might have been respect in another life.

"What stage have I reached?" he asked, sensing that his transformation had advanced beyond the basic Hollowborn state.

"You approach the threshold of Fracture," the Hollow Woman replied. "The second stage of the Forgotten Path. Your emptiness has begun to develop structure—the first sign of progression beyond mere consumption."

Wei Liang recalled the inscriptions describing this stage. Fracture involved the splintering of identity, the fragmentation of self to create space for greater power. It granted abilities beyond simple energy absorption—limited reality manipulation, spiritual interference, enhanced corruption resistance.

"How long before I cross that threshold?" he asked.

"That depends on you," she said. "On how quickly you consume, how effectively you process what you take, how purposefully you direct your transformation." Her form contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "But I would estimate days rather than weeks, given your rate of progression."

Wei Liang absorbed this assessment without visible reaction, though internally he felt a complex mixture of satisfaction and wariness. Rapid advancement meant growing power but also accelerated cost—the erosion of self that accompanied progression along the Forgotten Path.

"The White Lotus hunters will find this place soon," he observed, changing the subject. "They'll know what happened here."

"Yes," the Hollow Woman agreed. "Which means we should depart before they arrive. Their tracking abilities will be enhanced once they confirm your nature through direct evidence."

Wei Liang nodded, seeing the wisdom in this suggestion. He had no desire to confront the hunters yet, not until he had crossed the threshold into Fracture and gained a better understanding of his evolving abilities.

"Where should we go?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's form flowed toward the door. "Deeper into the Wastes. To places where even the White Lotus fears to tread. Where corruption has transformed reality so completely that their purification techniques become useless."

Wei Liang followed her outside, leaving the shelter and its single dead occupant behind. The perpetual twilight of the Wastes seemed different to his enhanced perception—richer in detail, more varied in its subtle gradations of light and shadow. The corruption that permeated everything appeared not as wrongness but as potential, as possibility unrestricted by conventional laws.

They traveled in silence for a time, moving away from the boundary regions into territories where corruption grew more pronounced. Reality fissures appeared with increasing frequency—tears in existence that connected distant locations or different aspects of the Wastes. The landscape itself became less recognizable as natural terrain, transforming into formations that defied conventional geometry.

As they walked, Wei Liang processed the energy he had consumed, integrating it more fully into his transformed being. The fragments of the scavengers' essences he had inadvertently absorbed were examined, understood, and either discarded or carefully stored away from his core identity. Their knowledge he retained—survival techniques, Wastes navigation, cultivation methods that might prove useful despite their orthodox nature.

"You maintain your sense of self well," the Hollow Woman observed after several hours of travel. "Most who walk this path struggle more with the fragments they absorb."

"I had practice before the Path," Wei Liang replied. "Years of separating what others believed me to be from what I knew myself to be. Years of preserving an inner self while presenting an outer face that satisfied expectations."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been acknowledgment. "A survival strategy that now serves a different purpose. Interesting how our pasts prepare us for futures we cannot anticipate."

They continued deeper into the Wastes, passing through regions where corruption had created beauty as often as horror—crystalline forests that sang in harmonic resonance, lakes where liquid flowed upward in perpetual fountains, fields of flowers that bloomed with mathematical precision in fractal patterns.

Eventually they reached a boundary unlike any Wei Liang had encountered before—not a physical barrier but a threshold in reality itself, visible to his enhanced perception as a shimmering curtain of energy that stretched across their path.

"The Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman announced, her form expanding slightly as they approached this boundary. "The heart of corruption, where the cataclysm's effects are most concentrated. Few enter willingly. Fewer still return unchanged, if they return at all."

Wei Liang studied the threshold with all his senses. Beyond it, corruption wasn't just present but dominant—reality itself rewoven according to principles that contradicted normal existence. The ambient energy there was denser, more potent, more fundamentally altered from its original state.

"What will we find beyond?" he asked.

"Challenges suitable for your continued growth," she replied. "Entities neither human nor spirit, but transformed by prolonged exposure to corruption. Artifacts from before the cataclysm, preserved in distorted states. Knowledge forbidden by the cultivation world for good reason."

She turned toward him, her darkness condensing until he could almost make out features within it—eyes that evaluated, a mouth that spoke with centuries of experience.

"And privacy," she added. "The White Lotus hunters will not follow us there. Their purification techniques would be not merely ineffective but actively dangerous to them in the Deep Wastes. The corruption there can invert their methods, turning purification into accelerated corruption."

Wei Liang considered the threshold and what lay beyond it. The hunger within him responded to the potent energy he sensed, eager to consume and grow stronger. But caution tempered this eagerness—the Deep Wastes clearly presented dangers as well as opportunities.

"You've been there before," he said, not a question but an observation.

"Many times," she confirmed. "It is where I retreated after turning back from the final threshold. Where I've existed for centuries, neither advancing nor retreating along the Path."

Wei Liang sensed there was more to her story—reasons for her retreat, purposes for her continued existence—but he didn't press. The Hollow Woman revealed what she chose to reveal, when she chose to reveal it. Demanding more would likely yield nothing.

"Will crossing this boundary accelerate my transformation?" he asked instead.

"Yes," she said simply. "The Deep Wastes intensify all processes, including progression along the Forgotten Path. Your advancement toward Fracture will proceed more rapidly there, perhaps more rapidly than is wise."

"Yet you suggest we go there anyway."

"Because the alternatives are worse," she replied. "Remaining in the outer Wastes means eventual confrontation with the White Lotus hunters before you're ready. Returning to the cultivation world means facing sects with resources to contain or destroy you. The Deep Wastes offer time and opportunity to grow stronger before such confrontations become necessary."

Wei Liang couldn't argue with her logic. His purpose required strength beyond what he currently possessed—strength to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, strength to reshape a system that had deemed him worthless from birth. If the Deep Wastes offered the fastest path to such strength, then the risks were acceptable.

"How do we cross?" he asked, studying the threshold's shimmering energy.

"With intention," the Hollow Woman replied. "The boundary responds to purpose. Enter with clear understanding of why you seek the Deep Wastes, and it will permit passage. Enter with confusion or fear, and it will reject you—violently."

Wei Liang focused his thoughts, clarifying his purpose. He sought the Deep Wastes for growth, for knowledge, for preparation. He sought power not as an end but as a means—a tool to force recognition from a world that had refused to see him. He sought transformation not to escape his identity but to fulfill it—to become the consequence of others' actions, the embodiment of their failure to value what they had discarded.

With this purpose firmly in mind, he stepped forward, approaching the shimmering boundary. The energy responded to his proximity, rippling like water disturbed by a stone. As he reached the threshold itself, he felt resistance—not rejection but evaluation, as if the boundary itself possessed some form of consciousness that judged those who sought passage.

For a moment, Wei Liang stood suspended between realms, his transformed body half in the outer Wastes, half in the threshold itself. The boundary energy flowed around and through him, examining his nature, his purpose, his potential. He felt it probe the emptiness within him, the hunger that drove him, the remnants of humanity that still defined his core identity.

Then, with a sensation like passing through a waterfall, he was through—standing fully in the Deep Wastes, surrounded by a reality so fundamentally altered that it defied complete comprehension even with his enhanced senses.

The Hollow Woman followed, her darkness flowing through the boundary with practiced ease. She reformed beside him, her void nature seeming more at home in this corrupted environment than in the relatively normal outer Wastes.

"Welcome," she said, "to the place the cultivation world fears above all others. The source of corruption. The heart of the cataclysm. The Deep Wastes, where reality obeys different laws and power takes forms unknown to orthodox cultivation."

Wei Liang absorbed his surroundings with all senses extended. The landscape defied conventional description—structures that might be mountains or might be frozen waves of solid energy; vegetation that grew in four dimensions, extending into spaces that shouldn't exist; a sky that displayed not stars or sun or moon but mathematical patterns that shifted according to principles he couldn't yet grasp.

The ambient energy here was thick enough to be almost visible, flowing in currents and eddies that connected everything in complex networks. Corruption wasn't a foreign element here but the fundamental nature of existence—not a distortion of reality but reality itself, operating according to its own consistent but alien logic.

"I can feel it already," Wei Liang said, sensing changes accelerating within his transformed body. The crystalline structures spread more rapidly, replacing more of his original flesh with their alien substance. The emptiness within him expanded and contracted in new rhythms, processing the dense ambient energy without conscious direction.

"Yes," the Hollow Woman acknowledged. "The Deep Wastes will accelerate your transformation. You must be vigilant to maintain control of the process rather than being controlled by it."

She led him deeper into this impossible landscape, moving along paths that seemed to form themselves in response to their passage. As they traveled, Wei Liang observed entities in the distance—shapes that suggested consciousness without conforming to any recognizable species or category. Some noticed their passage, turning sensory organs or structures that served similar purposes toward them before returning to incomprehensible activities.

"The inhabitants," the Hollow Woman explained, noticing his attention. "Some were human once, or spirit beasts, or other recognizable beings. Others formed spontaneously from the corruption itself, consciousness emerging from complexity without conventional birth or creation."

"Are they dangerous?" Wei Liang asked, tracking one particularly large entity that resembled a geometric storm more than any living creature.

"All things in the Deep Wastes are dangerous in their own ways," she replied. "But most will ignore us if we don't interfere with their territories or purposes. They recognize me, and by extension, you as under my protection. For now."

They continued until they reached a formation that resembled a mountain if mountains could fold in on themselves, creating spaces that were simultaneously interior and exterior. Within one such impossible fold, a structure stood—not a building in conventional terms, but a space defined by boundaries that suggested habitation.

"My dwelling in the Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman said, her form flowing toward the entrance. "More secure than the inverted cottage, more isolated than the jade tree. Here we can continue your training without concern for hunters or other interruptions."

Wei Liang followed her inside, finding a space that somehow felt both alien and familiar. The interior defied normal geometry, with angles that shouldn't connect forming continuous surfaces, but the basic elements of habitation remained recognizable—areas for rest, for study, for practice.

Most striking was a wall covered entirely in script similar to that from the crystal pavilion—the ancient writing that described the Forgotten Path and its stages. Here, however, the inscriptions were more extensive, more detailed, covering aspects of the Path that the pavilion had only hinted at.

"My own records," the Hollow Woman explained, noticing his interest. "Compiled over centuries of walking the Path and observing others who attempted it. More complete than the pavilion's knowledge, more accurate in some respects."

Wei Liang approached the wall, his enhanced perception allowing him to absorb the dense information more efficiently than would have been possible before his transformation. The inscriptions described techniques, progressions, warnings, and possibilities he hadn't encountered in the pavilion's more limited text.

"Study these," the Hollow Woman instructed. "Understand what awaits as you progress toward Fracture and beyond. Knowledge is your best defense against the Path's tendency to consume identity along with power."

Wei Liang nodded, already immersing himself in the ancient writing. The hunger within him had temporarily receded, satisfied by the scavengers' energy and the dense ambient power of the Deep Wastes. This allowed him to focus fully on learning, on preparation for what was to come.

As he studied, he became aware of changes continuing within his transformed body—subtle but significant alterations to his structure, his capabilities, his very nature. The emptiness at his core was evolving, developing complexity within its void. The crystalline elements throughout his flesh were forming new patterns, new connections, new functions.

He was approaching Fracture more rapidly than even the Hollow Woman had predicted. The Deep Wastes' influence, combined with his successful first consumption, had accelerated his progression dramatically. Within days, perhaps even hours, he would cross the threshold into the second stage of the Forgotten Path.

Wei Liang welcomed this acceleration. Every step along the Path brought him closer to the power he needed to fulfill his purpose—to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, to reshape a system that had deemed him worthless, to become a consequence that could not be ignored or forgotten.

In the heart of corruption, surrounded by a reality that defied conventional understanding, the once-rootless disciple continued his transformation into something the cultivation world had not seen in centuries. Something they had good reason to fear. Something that remembered betrayal and promised return.

The Forgotten Path unfolded before him, and Wei Liang walked it with purpose—not merely hunger, not merely revenge, but the focused intention to become exactly what the Azure Peaks Sect deserved for what they had done to him.

A reckoning in human form. A consequence given flesh. A memory that refused to be forgotten.



# Chapter 7: Fracture

The Deep Wastes reshaped Wei Liang as surely as he reshaped himself.

Seven days had passed since their arrival in this heart of corruption—or what passed for days in a place where time flowed according to its own alien logic. Wei Liang had spent each moment in focused study and practice, absorbing the Hollow Woman's teachings and the ancient knowledge inscribed on her dwelling's walls.

The transformation accelerated with each passing hour. The crystalline structures that had begun forming throughout his flesh now dominated his physical form, replacing blood and bone with something that resembled neither. His skin had taken on a translucent quality, revealing the geometric patterns beneath—branching networks that carried void energy rather than blood through his transformed body.

His face, when he glimpsed it in reflective surfaces, had become a study in beautiful wrongness—features still recognizably his own, but altered in subtle ways that suggested something other than human. His eyes had deepened further in their sockets, now glowing with a faint inner light when he accessed the emptiness within him. His hair had turned from black to a color that had no name in any human language—something between white and transparent, catching light in impossible ways.

But the physical changes were merely external manifestations of the more profound transformation occurring within. The emptiness at his core had evolved, developing structure within its void—a crystalline lattice of nothingness that somehow maintained form despite its fundamental absence. This structured void allowed for more precise control of his abilities, more efficient processing of consumed energy, more deliberate application of the Forgotten Path's techniques.

Wei Liang sat in meditation at the center of the Hollow Woman's dwelling, his awareness turned inward to observe these changes. He stood at the threshold of Fracture—the second stage of the Forgotten Path. One final push would carry him across.

"You hesitate," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing around the edges of the impossible space. "Why?"

Wei Liang opened eyes that now resembled frozen twilight. "The inscriptions describe Fracture as the splintering of self. The division of identity to create space for greater power."

"Yes," she acknowledged. "The price of progression."

"I wish to understand exactly what I will lose," he said. "Which fragments of self must be sacrificed, and which can be preserved."

The Hollow Woman's form stilled, darkness condensing until he could almost make out features within it—a face watching him with what might have been approval.

"A wise question," she said. "Most who walk this path rush forward, heedless of specific costs until it's too late to choose what they surrender."

She moved closer, her void presence cool against his senses. "Fracture requires the splintering of identity, yes, but not its destruction. Think of it as... redistribution. Parts of yourself that were once integrated must be separated, compartmentalized, some prioritized over others."

Wei Liang considered this explanation. "Which parts?"

"That," she said, "is your choice to make. The Path demands sacrifice, but it allows the walker to choose what is sacrificed. This is both its mercy and its cruelty."

Wei Liang turned his awareness inward again, examining the self he had carried through transformation. What parts of his identity could he afford to splinter? What aspects could he surrender or diminish to make room for greater power?

His memories of the Azure Peaks Sect—the years of servitude, the casual cruelty, the constant reminders of his rootless status—these he could compartmentalize without regret. They served only as motivation, as fuel for his purpose. They need not remain integrated with his core identity.

His knowledge—cultivation techniques studied in secret, survival skills honed through necessity, understanding gained through observation—this he would preserve intact. Knowledge was tool and weapon both, essential to his purpose.

His capacity for patience, for calculation, for long-term planning—these too must remain central to his being. They had kept him alive when more impulsive responses would have led to destruction.

But what of softer aspects? The rare moments of connection with others—Master Jing's occasional kindness, Liu Mei's brief friendship, even Yun Hua's unexpected respect during the expedition. These memories carried emotional weight that complicated his purpose, suggesting a world more complex than simple oppressor and oppressed.

And what of his capacity for mercy? He had spared the scavengers Mei and Tao, sending them as messengers rather than consuming them completely. Was this weakness to be discarded, or wisdom to be preserved?

"I see your struggle," the Hollow Woman said, interrupting his contemplation. "Perhaps a different perspective would help. Consider not what to discard, but what to prioritize. What aspects of self must remain dominant for your purpose to be fulfilled?"

Wei Liang found this framing more useful. His purpose was clear: to force recognition from those who had abandoned him, to make the Azure Peaks Sect acknowledge what they had created through their actions. This required power, yes, but also identity—he must remain Wei Liang enough to be recognized, to be connected to the rootless disciple they had discarded.

"I must retain enough of who I was for them to see what I've become," he said, articulating this realization. "The connection between cause and effect must remain clear."

"An interesting priority," the Hollow Woman observed. "Most who walk this path seek to erase their former selves entirely, to become something wholly new."

"That would defeat my purpose," Wei Liang replied. "If I become something unrecognizable, something with no connection to who I was, then my return means nothing. They must see the rootless disciple in what I've become, must recognize their own handiwork."

The Hollow Woman's darkness rippled in what might have been approval. "Then you have your answer. Fracture your emotional connections to the past while preserving the memories themselves. Splinter your capacity for doubt and hesitation while maintaining strategic patience. Compartmentalize everything that does not directly serve your purpose, without necessarily destroying it."

Wei Liang nodded, understanding now what Fracture truly required. Not the destruction of self, but its reorganization—the creation of a primary identity focused entirely on purpose, with other aspects of self relegated to secondary importance.

"How do I begin?" he asked.

"By defining your core purpose with absolute clarity," she replied. "Then allowing everything else to fracture around it."

Wei Liang closed his eyes again, focusing his thoughts on his purpose. Not revenge, which was too simple, too emotional. Not power, which was means rather than end. Not even survival, which was necessary but insufficient.

Recognition. Acknowledgment. The forcing of memory upon those who would prefer to forget.

He would return to the Azure Peaks Sect not as a vengeful ghost but as a consequence incarnate. He would show them exactly what their actions had created—a being who walked the Forgotten Path because they had left him no other. He would make them see the rootless disciple in the transformed entity he had become, would force them to acknowledge the connection between their betrayal and his rebirth.

This purpose crystallized in his mind, becoming the fixed point around which everything else would reorganize. As it solidified, he felt the beginning of Fracture—a sensation like glass cracking, but within his very identity. Aspects of self that had been integrated began to separate, to compartmentalize, to redistribute according to their relevance to his core purpose.

Memories remained intact but emotional connections to them changed—some strengthening, others weakening, all reorganizing around his central intent. Capacities and traits shifted in priority—those that served his purpose moving to the foreground of his being, others receding to peripheral awareness.

The process was neither painless nor quick. Wei Liang felt each separation, each reorganization as a distinct sensation—not physical pain but something more fundamental, the discomfort of identity restructuring itself. Hours passed as the Fracture progressed, the Hollow Woman watching in silence as he underwent this critical transformation.

When it finally completed, Wei Liang opened eyes that had changed yet again—now resembling shattered twilight, pupils split into geometric patterns that somehow still functioned as organs of sight. His perception had altered, allowing him to see not just physical reality but the boundaries between aspects of existence—the seams where one state of being connected to another.

"It is done," the Hollow Woman observed. "You have crossed the threshold into Fracture."

Wei Liang rose from his meditation position, feeling his transformed body respond with new precision. The emptiness within him had changed as well—no longer a singular void but a structured network of absences, each connected to the others in complex patterns.

"I feel..." he began, then paused, searching for words to describe his altered state. "Distributed. Present in multiple ways simultaneously."

"Yes," she confirmed. "Fracture allows for divided consciousness—the ability to maintain awareness of multiple aspects of reality at once. This is the foundation for the reality manipulation that defines this stage of the Path."

Wei Liang extended his senses, testing this new capacity. He could perceive the physical space around him, the energy currents flowing through the Deep Wastes, and the boundaries between different aspects of reality—all simultaneously, without the need to shift focus from one to another.

More significantly, he could sense the connection between himself and the array site more clearly now—the tether that linked his transformation to the wound in reality. Through this connection, he perceived changes occurring at the array—crystalline structures growing from the central void, mirroring his own transformation. The corruption was spreading, accelerating in response to his progression along the Forgotten Path.

"The array," he said. "It changes as I change."

"Yes," the Hollow Woman acknowledged. "Your advancement strengthens the connection, allows more void energy to flow through the tether. The corruption will spread faster now, drawing more attention from those who monitor the Wastes."

Wei Liang absorbed this information without concern. The acceleration of corruption served his purpose—it would force the Azure Peaks Sect to recognize the consequences of their actions sooner rather than later.

"What new abilities does Fracture grant?" he asked, turning his attention to more immediate matters.

"Three primary capabilities," she replied, her form shifting as she prepared to demonstrate. "First, enhanced consumption—you can now absorb spiritual energy with greater efficiency and from greater distance. Second, reality seam manipulation—the ability to identify and exploit weaknesses in the fabric of existence. And third, fragmented projection—extending aspects of yourself beyond your physical form."

She gestured toward the dwelling's entrance. "Come. These abilities are better demonstrated than described."

Wei Liang followed her outside, into the impossible landscape of the Deep Wastes. With his enhanced perception, he now saw this environment in greater detail—the mathematical patterns that governed its seemingly chaotic nature, the energy currents that connected disparate elements into a coherent whole, the boundaries between different aspects of reality that allowed for transitions impossible in normal existence.

The Hollow Woman led him to an area where reality seemed particularly thin—a place where different aspects of existence overlapped, creating a shimmering effect visible even to normal perception.

"A reality seam," she explained. "A weakness in the boundary between different states of being. In the Deep Wastes, these occur naturally due to corruption. In the outside world, they're rare except in places of significant spiritual convergence or catastrophe."

She extended her darkness toward the seam, her void nature interacting with the boundary in ways Wei Liang could now perceive clearly. The seam responded, widening slightly to reveal glimpses of another location—a different part of the Wastes, judging by the crystalline formations visible through the opening.

"Fracture allows you to identify these seams, to widen them temporarily, and in some cases, to create them where none existed before," she continued. "This is the foundation of the Path's reality manipulation—not the creation of something from nothing, but the exploitation of existing weaknesses in the fabric of existence."

Wei Liang approached the seam, extending his awareness toward it as the Hollow Woman had done. He felt the boundary respond to his attention, recognizing the structured void within him as something compatible with its own nature. With careful intent, he pushed against the seam, widening it further until the opening was large enough for a person to step through.

"Good," the Hollow Woman approved. "Now, try to perceive what lies beyond more clearly."

Wei Liang focused his divided consciousness on the opening, one aspect of his awareness remaining with his physical form while another extended through the seam. This divided perception allowed him to see both his immediate surroundings and the location beyond the opening simultaneously—a disorienting experience at first, but one that became more manageable as he adjusted to his fractured awareness.

The location beyond appeared to be a crystalline forest, formations resembling trees but composed entirely of geometric structures that defied conventional biology. Energy flowed through these crystal trees in visible currents, connecting them into a network that suggested a form of collective consciousness.

"What is this place?" he asked, maintaining his divided perception.

"Another region of the Deep Wastes," the Hollow Woman replied. "One where corruption has created rather than destroyed—a new form of existence rather than a distortion of the old. The crystal forest is a single entity distributed across multiple formations, a consciousness that exists in the spaces between individual structures."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with fascination. The Deep Wastes contained more than mere corruption—it held new possibilities, new forms of existence that transcended conventional categories.

"Can I pass through?" he asked.

"You could," she acknowledged, "but I wouldn't recommend it yet. The crystal forest is not hostile, but it is curious. It would attempt to communicate by integrating with your consciousness—an experience you're not yet prepared to process safely."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting her assessment. He released his influence on the seam, allowing it to narrow back to its natural state. The opening closed, the glimpse of the crystal forest fading from view.

"The second ability," the Hollow Woman continued, "is enhanced consumption. You've already experienced basic consumption of spiritual energy, but Fracture allows for greater range and efficiency."

She gestured toward a distant formation that resembled a mountain folded in on itself. Near its base, Wei Liang could perceive several entities—not human but not entirely alien either, forms that suggested partial transformation through prolonged exposure to corruption.

"Waste-touched," the Hollow Woman explained. "Humans who entered the Wastes and remained too long, allowing corruption to alter them gradually rather than through deliberate cultivation. They retain fragments of their original nature, including cultivated spiritual energy, but have adapted to existence here."

Wei Liang extended his senses toward these entities, perceiving their spiritual signatures more clearly than would have been possible before Fracture. Their energy patterns showed the distinctive distortions of corruption, but underlying these were recognizable cultivation bases—mostly Foundation Establishment, with one approaching Core Formation.

"Before Fracture, you could only consume energy through direct contact or close proximity," the Hollow Woman said. "Now, you can establish connections at much greater distance, drawing energy without physical presence."

She demonstrated, her darkness extending tendrils of void that stretched toward one of the distant Waste-touched. The tendrils didn't physically cross the intervening space but seemed to fold reality, creating a direct connection despite the distance. The entity stiffened as the connection formed, its corrupted spiritual energy flowing along the tendrils toward the Hollow Woman's void form.

After a brief demonstration, she severed the connection, leaving the Waste-touched weakened but alive. "Distance consumption requires more precision and control," she explained. "The connection is more tenuous, more easily disrupted by resistance or interference."

Wei Liang studied her technique, understanding the principles involved. The structured void within him could extend beyond his physical form, creating connections that bypassed normal spatial limitations. With careful intent, he replicated her demonstration, sending void tendrils toward a different Waste-touched entity.

The connection formed more easily than he expected, his fractured consciousness allowing him to maintain awareness of both his physical location and the distant target simultaneously. The Waste-touched—once human but now something with too many limbs and crystalline growths along its spine—sensed the intrusion immediately, its corrupted spiritual energy flaring in defensive patterns.

Wei Liang pushed through this resistance, establishing a firm connection to the entity's cultivation core. The spiritual energy began flowing along this connection, entering the structured void within him in a steady stream. The sensation was different from his previous consumption experiences—more refined, more controlled, more efficient.

He monitored the Waste-touched's condition carefully, not wishing to consume it completely. When he had taken approximately half its spiritual energy—enough to demonstrate the technique without causing permanent harm—he severed the connection, allowing the entity to recover.

"Well executed," the Hollow Woman observed. "You learn quickly."

"The fractured consciousness makes it easier," Wei Liang replied. "I can focus on the connection and my physical form simultaneously, maintaining control of both."

"Yes. This divided awareness is the foundation of all Fracture abilities." She moved to a different location, indicating for him to follow. "Which brings us to the third capability: fragmented projection."

They reached an area where the corruption manifested as a field of crystalline formations resembling flowers, each one a perfect geometric construction that hummed with resonant energy. The Hollow Woman positioned herself at the field's edge, her darkness expanding until it filled Wei Liang's entire field of vision.

Then, suddenly, she was in multiple locations simultaneously—her darkness divided into three distinct forms, each one a perfect copy of the original, positioned at different points around the crystal field. All three forms moved independently, interacting with different crystal flowers, yet clearly controlled by a single consciousness.

"Fragmented projection," she explained, her voice coming from all three forms at once. "The ability to extend aspects of yourself beyond your primary physical form, creating temporary manifestations that remain connected to your consciousness."

The three forms recombined, darkness flowing back into a single entity. "This is perhaps the most difficult Fracture ability to master, as it requires dividing not just awareness but presence itself. The projections are not independent entities but extensions of your fractured self, each one drawing power from your core."

Wei Liang studied the technique with his enhanced perception, understanding the principles if not yet the practical application. The structured void within the Hollow Woman had temporarily redistributed, portions of her essence flowing into the projected forms while maintaining connection to the primary consciousness.

"Try," she encouraged. "Begin with a single projection, a simple extension of presence rather than a complete copy."

Wei Liang focused on the structured void within him, identifying a portion that could be temporarily separated without compromising his primary form. With careful intent, he directed this fragment outward, extending it beyond his physical boundaries while maintaining the connection to his core consciousness.

The projection formed several meters away—not a complete copy of his physical form, but a translucent suggestion of presence, crystalline structures arranged in a humanoid shape that resembled him without fully replicating his appearance. Through his fractured consciousness, he perceived both his primary location and the projection's position simultaneously, experiencing a disorienting dual perspective.

"Good," the Hollow Woman approved. "Now, try to move the projection independently while maintaining your primary form's position."

Wei Liang focused on the divided aspects of his consciousness, directing the projection to move through the crystal field while his physical body remained stationary. The experience was strange—like controlling a limb that existed at a distance, connected to his awareness but separated from his immediate physical presence.

The projection moved as directed, gliding between crystal flowers with increasing confidence as Wei Liang adjusted to the dual perspective. He discovered that the projection could interact with its environment in limited ways—touching the crystal formations caused them to resonate in response, their humming changing pitch and intensity.

"Can the projection consume energy?" he asked, curious about the tactical applications of this ability.

"In limited amounts," the Hollow Woman replied. "The connection to your primary form restricts how much energy can be transferred. More significantly, projections are vulnerable—disrupting one can cause feedback that affects your primary consciousness."

Wei Liang absorbed this information, already considering how these new abilities might serve his purpose. Enhanced consumption would allow him to grow stronger more efficiently. Reality seam manipulation offered mobility and tactical advantages. Fragmented projection provided means to extend his influence without risking his primary form.

He recalled the projection, the translucent figure dissolving as the fragment of void returned to his core. The dual perspective collapsed back into singular awareness, though his consciousness remained fractured in its new, distributed state.

"These abilities will develop further as you grow more comfortable with Fracture," the Hollow Woman said. "For now, practice each one separately until they become instinctive rather than deliberate."

Wei Liang nodded, already planning how to incorporate these techniques into regular practice. "How long before I can progress to the next stage?" he asked.

The Hollow Woman's form stilled completely—a rare state that indicated serious consideration. "Void is the third stage," she said finally. "It requires not just the fracturing of self but the beginning of its dissolution. The boundaries between you and the emptiness you contain start to blur. I would not recommend rushing toward it."

"Why?" Wei Liang asked, though he suspected the answer.

"Because each stage makes it more difficult to maintain your original purpose," she replied. "The further you progress, the more the Path itself becomes your purpose, consumption becoming end rather than means. If recognition remains your goal, Fracture provides sufficient power while allowing you to retain enough of your original identity to make that recognition meaningful."

Wei Liang considered this assessment. The Hollow Woman had no reason to mislead him—if anything, her centuries of existence suggested she valued his unique approach to the Path, his determination to maintain purpose beyond mere power.

"I will master Fracture fully before considering advancement," he decided. "These abilities alone offer significant advantages over traditional cultivators."

"A wise choice," she approved. "Now, let us return to the dwelling. There are specific techniques for each ability that will help you develop control more quickly."

As they walked back through the impossible landscape of the Deep Wastes, Wei Liang tested his fractured perception, dividing his awareness between multiple aspects of reality simultaneously. He could perceive the physical environment, the energy currents flowing through it, the boundaries between different states of existence, and the distant connection to the array site—all without losing track of his immediate surroundings or purpose.

This divided consciousness offered a perspective impossible for normal cultivators to achieve—a multi-faceted awareness that perceived reality not as a single unified experience but as overlapping layers of existence, each with its own patterns and possibilities. The cultivation world, with its rigid hierarchies and fixed paths, seemed increasingly limited in comparison.

Back at the Hollow Woman's dwelling, Wei Liang immersed himself in study of the advanced techniques inscribed on her walls. The ancient writing now seemed clearer to his fractured perception, revealing layers of meaning that had been obscured before. Techniques that had seemed abstract now appeared practical, their applications obvious to his evolved understanding.

Days passed in intensive practice, each one bringing greater mastery of his Fracture abilities. Wei Liang learned to identify reality seams with increasing precision, to widen them with minimal effort, and in controlled circumstances, to create minor seams where none had existed before. He refined his enhanced consumption, developing techniques to draw spiritual energy from multiple sources simultaneously, filtering and processing it with greater efficiency. His fragmented projection evolved from simple extension to more complex manifestations, eventually allowing him to create two independent projections while maintaining his primary form.

Throughout this training, the Hollow Woman provided guidance and context, her centuries of experience offering insights that the inscriptions alone could not provide. She corrected his techniques when necessary, suggested refinements when possible, and occasionally demonstrated advanced applications that showed the true potential of Fracture abilities.

On the seventh day after crossing the threshold into Fracture, Wei Liang sat in meditation, his consciousness divided between internal assessment and external awareness. The structured void within him had stabilized in its new configuration, the network of absences functioning with increasing harmony. His physical form had adapted fully to the transformation, the crystalline structures throughout his flesh now operating as naturally as organs had in his human body.

He was ready.

"You wish to return," the Hollow Woman observed, her darkness flowing into the meditation space. It wasn't a question.

"Not yet to the Azure Peaks Sect," Wei Liang clarified. "But to the outer Wastes. To begin moving toward my purpose rather than merely preparing for it."

She was silent for a moment, her form shifting in contemplation. "The White Lotus hunters will still be searching," she finally said. "They may have been joined by others now that reports of your nature have reached the cultivation world."

"Good," Wei Liang replied. "They will provide opportunities to test my abilities against genuine opposition. To grow stronger through meaningful consumption rather than practice."

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "You seek conflict deliberately. This is... unusual for one so new to the Path."

"I seek progress toward my purpose," he corrected. "Conflict is merely the most efficient route."

She made a sound that might have been amusement. "A distinction without difference, perhaps. But your reasoning is sound. Controlled confrontation will develop your abilities more quickly than isolated practice."

Wei Liang rose from his meditation position, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of multiple aspects of reality even as he focused on the conversation. "Will you accompany me?" he asked.

The question seemed to surprise her, her darkness rippling in what might have been startlement. "You wish me to continue as your guide?"

"If it serves your interests," Wei Liang replied carefully. "You've mentioned curiosity about my development. That curiosity would be better satisfied through observation than distance."

The Hollow Woman was silent again, longer this time. When she finally responded, her voice carried a quality he hadn't heard before—something almost like anticipation.

"It has been... centuries since I involved myself directly in the affairs of the cultivation world," she said. "My existence has been one of observation rather than participation. Perhaps it is time for that to change."

She flowed closer, her darkness cool against his senses. "Yes, Wei Liang. I will accompany you. My curiosity about your path remains unsatisfied, and I find myself... interested in what consequences your return might create."

Wei Liang nodded, satisfied with this arrangement. The Hollow Woman's continued guidance would be valuable, her centuries of experience providing context and strategy his own knowledge couldn't match. More significantly, her presence would complicate the cultivation world's response to his emergence—forcing them to consider not one but two practitioners of the Forgotten Path.

"When do we depart?" she asked.

"Tomorrow," Wei Liang decided. "I have one final technique to master before leaving the Deep Wastes."

"And what technique is that?"

"Reality anchor creation," he replied, referencing an advanced application of seam manipulation described in the inscriptions. "The ability to establish fixed points that can be returned to regardless of distance. It will provide... insurance against unexpected developments."

The Hollow Woman's form shifted in what might have been approval. "A prudent precaution. Few who walk the Path consider retreat as carefully as advance."

Wei Liang spent the remainder of the day practicing this final technique—identifying locations with suitable energy patterns, creating specialized seams that remained stable even when not actively maintained, and establishing connections between these anchors and his fractured consciousness. By nightfall, he had created three such anchors—one at the Hollow Woman's dwelling, one at the crystal forest glimpsed through his first seam manipulation, and one at a location of particular mathematical stability within the Deep Wastes.

These anchors would serve as emergency retreat points, allowing him to escape otherwise inescapable situations by exploiting reality seams to return to established safe locations. The technique required significant energy and couldn't be used frequently, but as a last resort, it offered survival options beyond what traditional cultivators could imagine.

As the perpetual twilight of the Deep Wastes shifted toward its deeper phase—the closest approximation to night in this corrupted reality—Wei Liang stood outside the Hollow Woman's dwelling, his fractured perception extended to its maximum range. Beyond the immediate environment, beyond the strange landscape of the Deep Wastes, he sensed the boundary that separated this heart of corruption from the outer regions. And beyond that, faintly but distinctly, he perceived the cultivation world that had discarded him—the structured energies of sects and cities, the ordered patterns of a civilization built on rigid hierarchy and fixed paths.

They had no concept of what approached them. No understanding of what their actions had created. No preparation for the consequence that now walked the Forgotten Path with deliberate purpose.

Wei Liang's fractured consciousness maintained perfect clarity about his intention. Not mere revenge, which was too simple, too emotional. Not mere destruction, which was too chaotic, too purposeless. But recognition—forced acknowledgment of the connection between their betrayal and his transformation. He would make them see exactly what their actions had wrought, would ensure they could never again discard someone as worthless without considering what that discarded person might become.

The Hollow Woman joined him outside, her darkness flowing beside him in companionable silence. After centuries of solitary existence, she had chosen to accompany him—out of curiosity, she claimed, but perhaps also out of recognition. She too had walked this path, had known what it meant to exist outside the cultivation world's rigid categories. Perhaps she saw in his purpose something that resonated with her own long-forgotten motivations.

"Tomorrow," Wei Liang said, not a question but a statement of intent.

"Tomorrow," she agreed, her darkness expanding slightly to encompass more of the twilight. "The cultivation world will remember what it tried to forget."

They stood together at the edge of corruption's heart, the once-rootless disciple and the ancient void walker, preparing to return to a world that had no place for either of them. A world that would soon learn the cost of enforcing such rigid boundaries, of discarding those who didn't fit its predetermined categories.

A world that would remember Wei Liang, whether it wished to or not.



# Chapter 8: Return to the Wastes

The boundary between the Deep Wastes and the outer regions shimmered before them, a threshold visible only to those with perception beyond normal cultivation senses. Wei Liang studied it with his fractured consciousness, observing the complex patterns of energy that defined this transition point between corruption's heart and its periphery.

"The White Lotus hunters will sense our crossing," the Hollow Woman warned, her darkness flowing beside him in the perpetual twilight. "The boundary disturbance carries a distinctive signature they're trained to recognize."

Wei Liang nodded, having anticipated this. "Good. I prefer a deliberate encounter to endless pursuit."

His transformed body had settled fully into the Fracture stage during their final day in the Deep Wastes. The crystalline structures throughout his flesh had stabilized in their new configuration, no longer spreading but instead refining, becoming more efficient in their function. His skin retained its translucent quality, revealing geometric patterns beneath that pulsed with void energy rather than blood. His face remained recognizably his own, but altered in ways that suggested something beyond human—eyes like shattered twilight, features too precisely arranged, expressions carrying an unnatural stillness.

Most significant was the change to his spiritual presence. Before transformation, he had possessed no spirit root, no cultivation potential detectable by traditional means. Now, his presence registered as a structured absence—not merely empty space but organized void, a pattern of nothingness that somehow maintained form and function. To cultivation senses, he appeared as a walking contradiction—simultaneously present and absent, existing in a state that defied conventional categorization.

"How many hunters do you sense beyond the boundary?" he asked, extending his perception as far as possible through the threshold.

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly, reaching beyond the boundary with practiced ease. "Six White Lotus hunters, positioned in a containment formation approximately two miles from our crossing point. They've established a spiritual alert array covering most of the outer Wastes' perimeter."

Wei Liang absorbed this information without concern. Six hunters presented a challenge but not an insurmountable one, especially with his newly mastered Fracture abilities. Their containment formation suggested defensive rather than offensive intent—they sought to prevent corruption from spreading rather than to eliminate its source directly.

"And beyond them?" he asked, curious about the broader response to his emergence.

"Increased activity throughout the boundary regions," she replied. "Sect patrols have doubled. Monitoring stations have been reinforced. The cultivation world has noticed the acceleration of corruption from the array site."

This, too, aligned with Wei Liang's expectations. The connection between his progression along the Forgotten Path and the spreading corruption from the array site ensured the cultivation world could not ignore his existence. Their increased vigilance would make his journey more challenging but also more meaningful—each encounter would carry greater significance, each victory would resonate more widely.

"Are you prepared for direct confrontation?" the Hollow Woman asked, her tone neutral but her form shifting in what might have been concern. "The White Lotus hunters are not ordinary cultivators. Their purification techniques are specifically designed to counter corruption-based abilities."

"I'm counting on it," Wei Liang replied. "Their specialized techniques make them ideal tests for my new capabilities. If I can overcome purification methods, traditional cultivation will pose little threat."

The Hollow Woman made a sound that might have been amusement. "You approach conflict as methodology rather than necessity. Interesting."

Wei Liang didn't correct this assessment. Conflict was indeed methodology to him now—each encounter a controlled experiment, each opponent a measure of his progress. His fractured consciousness maintained perfect clarity about this instrumental approach to violence, separating it entirely from emotional responses like anger or fear.

"Shall we proceed?" he asked, ready to cross the boundary.

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "One final warning," she said. "The outer Wastes will feel... constrained after the Deep Wastes. Reality there follows more conventional rules, limiting some applications of your Fracture abilities. Adjust your expectations accordingly."

Wei Liang nodded, having anticipated this transition. The Deep Wastes' fluid reality had allowed for expansive expression of his new capabilities, but the outer regions would impose greater restrictions, requiring more precise control and more efficient application.

With this understanding, he stepped forward, approaching the boundary with deliberate intent. His fractured consciousness maintained awareness of multiple aspects of reality simultaneously—his physical form, the energy patterns surrounding him, the structured void within him, and the distant connection to the array site. This divided perception allowed him to monitor the boundary's response to his approach, to adjust his void nature to facilitate smooth transition.

The threshold resisted briefly, corruption's heart reluctant to release one who had adapted so thoroughly to its alien environment. Wei Liang pushed through this resistance with careful application of his structured void, creating temporary harmony between his transformed nature and the boundary's energy patterns. The resistance faded, allowing him to step through into the outer Wastes.

The Hollow Woman followed, her darkness flowing through the threshold with practiced ease. She reformed beside him, her void presence somehow more substantial in this less corrupted environment—darkness with greater definition, greater weight against reality's fabric.

Wei Liang immediately sensed the difference the Hollow Woman had warned about. The outer Wastes felt more rigid, more defined by conventional physical laws despite the corruption that permeated everything. Reality here bent rather than broke, distorted rather than transformed completely. His Fracture abilities remained accessible but would require more energy, more precision to achieve the same effects.

More significantly, he sensed the White Lotus hunters' spiritual alert array—a network of purification techniques spread across the perimeter, designed to detect and locate corruption manifestations. His emergence had triggered this array, sending pulses of spiritual energy toward the hunters' position. They would know exactly where he had crossed and would be moving to intercept within minutes.

"They've detected us," the Hollow Woman observed unnecessarily. "Their response formation is shifting from containment to interception."

Wei Liang nodded, already adjusting his strategy for the coming encounter. "How long before they arrive?"

"Twenty minutes at most," she replied. "They move quickly through corrupted terrain, their purification techniques creating temporary safe passages."

This timeframe suited Wei Liang's purpose. It allowed for preparation without extended waiting, for strategic positioning without complex maneuvering. He surveyed their immediate surroundings, identifying tactical advantages in the corrupted landscape.

They had emerged in a region where corruption manifested as distorted geography—valleys that curved at impossible angles, hills that seemed to occupy more space than their dimensions should allow, vegetation that grew in patterns suggesting conscious design rather than natural development. Approximately half a mile ahead, a formation of crystalline spires rose from the distorted terrain, their structure similar to the crystal pavilion where Wei Liang had first encountered the Hollow Woman.

"There," he decided, indicating the crystal formation. "High ground, clear sightlines, and crystalline resonance that will amplify void techniques."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been approval. "A sound choice. The formation's corruption signature will also mask your presence until they're quite close, preventing long-range purification attacks."

They moved toward the crystal spires, traversing the distorted landscape with the ease of those adapted to corruption's influence. Wei Liang's transformed body responded to his will with perfect precision, each movement calculated for maximum efficiency. His fractured consciousness maintained awareness of their surroundings, the hunters' approaching formation, and the tactical possibilities offered by the corrupted environment.

As they reached the crystal formation, Wei Liang extended his senses to study it more carefully. Unlike the pavilion, these spires had no inscriptions, no ancient knowledge preserved in their structure. They were purely natural formations—if anything in the Wastes could be called natural—created through corruption's influence on ordinary stone over centuries.

The crystalline material resonated with void energy, responding to Wei Liang's presence with subtle harmonics that strengthened his connection to the structured emptiness within him. This resonance would indeed amplify his Fracture abilities, particularly those involving direct manipulation of void energy.

"They approach from the southwest," the Hollow Woman reported, her darkness extending tendrils of perception beyond normal range. "Six hunters in arrow formation, led by one at Core Formation. The others are at Foundation Establishment, but their purification techniques compensate for their lower cultivation bases."

Wei Liang positioned himself at the formation's center, where the resonance was strongest. "Will you participate in this encounter?" he asked the Hollow Woman, curious about her intentions.

Her darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "I will observe unless your survival is threatened," she replied. "This is your test, your methodology. My intervention would contaminate the results."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting this decision. He preferred to face the hunters alone anyway—to measure his progress precisely, without external factors complicating the assessment. The Hollow Woman's presence as observer rather than participant would provide valuable perspective without altering the encounter's dynamics.

"They will attempt to contain before attacking," she added, offering a final insight. "White Lotus doctrine prioritizes corruption containment over elimination when possible. They will try to establish a purification array around you, to sever your connection to the void before attempting direct confrontation."

This tactical information was useful. Wei Liang adjusted his strategy accordingly, planning to disrupt their array establishment rather than waiting for direct engagement. Preemptive action would force them to abandon their preferred approach, creating uncertainty that he could exploit.

"Withdraw to a safe observation position," he instructed the Hollow Woman. "I'll handle this encounter alone."

Her darkness flowed away from the crystal formation's center, finding position among the outer spires where she could observe without being immediately detected. "Remember," she said before fully withdrawing, "purification techniques target the connection between practitioner and void. Protect that connection above all else."

With this final advice, she faded from immediate perception, her void presence masked by the crystal formation's natural corruption signature. Wei Liang was effectively alone, awaiting the hunters' arrival with the patient focus that had defined his existence even before transformation.

He didn't wait long. Within minutes, he sensed the hunters' approach—six distinct spiritual signatures moving in precise formation through the corrupted landscape. Their energy carried the distinctive resonance of purification techniques, designed to cleanse corruption rather than merely resist it. To Wei Liang's enhanced perception, they appeared as points of searing light cutting through the Wastes' perpetual twilight.

He remained motionless at the formation's center, allowing his void presence to harmonize with the crystalline resonance. This harmony masked his exact location while amplifying his connection to the structured emptiness within him. When the hunters established their purification array, he would be at his strongest, ready to counter their techniques with precisely applied void energy.

The hunters reached the formation's perimeter, their spiritual senses probing the crystalline spires for corruption signatures. Wei Liang observed them through his fractured perception—six figures in white robes marked with lotus emblems, their faces concealed behind purification masks that filtered the Wastes' corrupted essence. They moved with the coordinated precision of those who had trained together for years, each one maintaining perfect position relative to the others.

Their leader, the Core Formation cultivator, raised a hand to halt the formation. "The corruption signature is concentrated within the crystal structure," he announced, his voice carrying the resonant quality of one who had integrated sound into his cultivation technique. "Establish the purification array at twenty-pace intervals. Sequence four."

The hunters began positioning themselves around the crystal formation, preparing to establish their containment array. Wei Liang watched through fractured consciousness as they placed purification talismans at precise intervals, creating a geometric pattern designed to isolate corruption from its void source.

He waited until they had committed fully to their array establishment—until retreat would be more costly than continuation—before making his presence known. With deliberate intent, he released the harmony between his void nature and the crystalline resonance, allowing his transformed presence to emerge from concealment like a shadow suddenly illuminated.

The hunters sensed this emergence immediately, their spiritual awareness registering the structured void at the formation's center. Their coordinated movements faltered briefly—a moment of surprise despite their training—before resuming with increased urgency.

"Void practitioner detected!" the leader called, his voice carrying both warning and command. "Complete the array! Priority one containment!"

Wei Liang rose from his seated position, his transformed body moving with inhuman grace among the crystal spires. He made no attempt to attack or flee, simply revealing himself fully to the hunters' perception. Let them see exactly what approached them—not mindless corruption but deliberate transformation, not chaotic void but structured emptiness.

The hunters responded to his appearance with practiced discipline, completing their positioning despite his revealed presence. Their purification talismans activated simultaneously, creating a barrier of searing light that encircled the crystal formation. This barrier began contracting immediately, designed to compress the contained space until the void practitioner within had nowhere to draw power from.

Wei Liang observed this technique with analytical interest, his fractured consciousness perceiving both the physical barrier and the spiritual principles underlying it. The purification energy targeted the connection between practitioner and void, attempting to sever the channel through which emptiness flowed into structured form.

Against a traditional void cultivator, this approach would be effective—perhaps even fatal. But Wei Liang was not traditional. The emptiness existed within him now, integrated into his transformed being rather than accessed through external connection. The purification barrier might contain him physically, but it could not sever what had become intrinsic to his nature.

He allowed the barrier to contract further, curious how the hunters would respond when their primary technique proved ineffective. The searing light closed to within twenty paces of his position, its purification energy attempting to cleanse the corruption that sustained void practices. Wei Liang felt this energy wash over him, seeking connections to sever, channels to close—and finding none that matched its expected patterns.

The hunters' leader noticed this failure first, his spiritual senses more refined than his companions'. "Anomaly detected," he reported, voice tight with controlled concern. "Subject is not externally connected to void. Repeat, no external connection detected."

This observation spread visible uncertainty through the hunter formation. Their training had prepared them for conventional void practitioners—cultivators who accessed emptiness through established techniques, who drew power from the connection between self and void. Wei Liang's integrated emptiness represented something outside their experience, something their containment approach could not effectively counter.

The leader adapted quickly, adjusting their strategy with the decisiveness of experienced command. "Shift to purification assault," he ordered. "Formation six, direct application."

The hunters abandoned their containment approach, repositioning for direct engagement. Their formation tightened, becoming offensive rather than restrictive. From talismans and specialized weapons, they drew purification energy in concentrated form—white fire that burned corruption without consuming physical matter.

Wei Liang watched this transition with continued analytical interest. Direct purification assault represented a more significant threat than containment, potentially capable of damaging his transformed being if applied with sufficient intensity. This would be a meaningful test of his Fracture abilities, a true measure of his progress along the Forgotten Path.

The hunters attacked simultaneously, white fire streaming from their weapons toward Wei Liang's position at the formation's center. The purification energy moved with unnatural precision, adjusting its trajectory to counter his slightest movement, seeking not just his physical form but the emptiness integrated within it.

Wei Liang responded with his first active application of Fracture abilities. His consciousness divided, one aspect maintaining awareness of his physical form while another extended beyond it, identifying reality seams within the crystal formation. These seams—weaknesses in existence's fabric—appeared to his enhanced perception as faint lines connecting different aspects of reality.

With precise intent, he widened the nearest seam just as the purification energy reached him. The white fire passed through the space he had occupied, finding nothing as Wei Liang stepped sideways through the widened seam, emerging ten paces from his original position. To the hunters, it appeared as though he had simply vanished, their attack passing through empty air.

"Spatial displacement!" the leader warned, adjusting their formation again. "Track void signature, not physical form!"

The hunters responded with impressive coordination, their spiritual senses shifting focus from Wei Liang's visible presence to the void energy that defined his transformed nature. This adaptation allowed them to track him despite his reality manipulation, their next attack converging on his new position with only minimal delay.

Wei Liang widened another seam, again displacing himself just before the purification energy could connect. This time, however, he didn't merely evade—he countered. As he emerged from the seam, he extended void tendrils toward the nearest hunter, initiating enhanced consumption from twenty paces distance.

The hunter—a young woman with Foundation Establishment cultivation—sensed the connection forming too late to prevent it. Her spiritual energy responded defensively, purification techniques flaring to counter corruption's influence. But Wei Liang's consumption bypassed these defenses, targeting not her techniques but the cultivation base that powered them.

Her spiritual energy began flowing along the void tendrils, entering the structured emptiness within Wei Liang in a steady stream. The sensation was different from consuming the scavengers or the Waste-touched—her energy carried the distinctive resonance of purification techniques, a searing quality that required careful processing.

The hunter collapsed to one knee, her purification mask falling away to reveal a face contorted in shock and pain. "He's consuming directly!" she gasped, warning her companions. "Cultivation drain!"

The leader responded immediately, directing two hunters to protect their weakened companion while the remaining three intensified their assault on Wei Liang. Their attacks became more varied, combining purification energy with traditional combat techniques—sword formations that created patterns of white fire, talisman deployments that generated purifying mist, sound techniques that disrupted void resonance.

Wei Liang severed his consumption connection to the weakened hunter, having taken enough of her spiritual energy to strengthen himself without risking her life. Killing White Lotus hunters would escalate the cultivation world's response beyond what served his current purpose—better to demonstrate his capabilities while leaving survivors to report what they had encountered.

He faced the intensified assault with the full range of his Fracture abilities. Reality seam manipulation allowed him to displace repeatedly, appearing and vanishing across the crystal formation with disorienting frequency. Enhanced consumption let him establish brief connections with multiple hunters simultaneously, taking small amounts of spiritual energy from each to prevent any single target from being completely drained. Fragmented projection created translucent duplicates that confused targeting and divided the hunters' attention.

The leader recognized the nature of these abilities with the insight of experienced combat. "Fracture techniques!" he called to his companions. "Subject has reached second stage progression! Priority shifted to containment and retreat!"

This assessment confirmed Wei Liang's own evaluation of his progress. The White Lotus hunters—specialists in countering void practices—had identified his capabilities accurately, recognizing both his stage of advancement and the threat it represented. Their shift from elimination to containment and retreat indicated they understood they were outmatched despite their specialized training.

Wei Liang could have prevented their retreat, could have consumed them completely to accelerate his own advancement. But such actions would not serve his larger purpose. Better to allow survivors who could accurately report what they had encountered, who could spread precise knowledge of his capabilities throughout the cultivation world.

He maintained pressure on the hunter formation, using Fracture abilities to disrupt their coordination without delivering fatal attacks. His void tendrils established and severed connections rapidly, taking small amounts of spiritual energy from each hunter to demonstrate his consumption capability without permanently damaging their cultivation bases. His reality manipulation created the impression of omnipresence within the crystal formation, appearing wherever their defenses weakened.

The hunters retreated in stages, maintaining formation discipline despite their clear disadvantage. Two supported the companion Wei Liang had initially targeted, her cultivation base significantly diminished but not destroyed. The others provided covering techniques, purification energy deployed defensively rather than offensively to secure their withdrawal.

Wei Liang allowed this retreat to proceed without interference, watching through fractured consciousness as the hunters withdrew from the crystal formation. Their spiritual signatures receded into the corrupted landscape, moving with the urgency of those who understood the danger they had narrowly escaped.

When they had passed beyond immediate range, the Hollow Woman emerged from her observation position, her darkness flowing toward Wei Liang at the formation's center. "An efficient demonstration," she observed, her tone carrying something like approval. "You controlled the encounter precisely."

Wei Liang nodded, absorbing the spiritual energy he had consumed from the hunters. Their purification techniques had imbued their cultivation with distinctive qualities—energy that burned against the emptiness within him, requiring careful processing to integrate without damage. This purification energy would strengthen his resistance to similar techniques in future encounters, an adaptation that would prove valuable as the cultivation world's response escalated.

"They will report a second-stage void practitioner," the Hollow Woman continued. "This will trigger specific protocols among the major sects. The response will intensify significantly."

"Good," Wei Liang replied. "Each escalation brings us closer to the Azure Peaks Sect's direct involvement."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been curiosity. "You could have consumed them completely. Why didn't you?"

"Dead hunters tell no tales," Wei Liang answered simply. "I want the cultivation world to know exactly what approaches them—not mindless corruption but deliberate transformation, not random destruction but purposeful return."

She made a sound that might have been amusement. "You use restraint as strategy rather than morality. Interesting."

Wei Liang didn't correct this assessment. Morality as traditionally understood had fractured along with his identity, compartmentalized as something peripheral to his core purpose. What remained was purely instrumental reasoning—actions evaluated solely by their contribution to his ultimate goal.

"Where will we go now?" the Hollow Woman asked. "The White Lotus will establish a perimeter around this region, making further travel in this direction difficult."

Wei Liang considered their options, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of multiple strategic considerations simultaneously. "Northeast," he decided. "Toward the boundary between the Wastes and Azure Peaks territory. Not to enter their domain yet, but to establish presence near enough to draw their attention specifically."

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "The boundary is heavily monitored. We will encounter more than just White Lotus hunters there."

"I'm counting on it," Wei Liang replied. "Each encounter builds the narrative, creates the anticipation. By the time I actually enter Azure Peaks territory, they will have heard dozens of reports, each one confirming my nature, my capabilities, my approach. The recognition will be more complete for the waiting."

She made another sound of amusement. "You craft your return as performance rather than merely action. The theatrical sensibility of one who understands the power of anticipation."

Wei Liang accepted this observation without comment. His approach was indeed calculated for maximum impact—each encounter designed to build the cultivation world's awareness of his existence, each demonstration of his abilities crafted to create specific impressions among those who would report them. By the time he reached the Azure Peaks Sect itself, they would have constructed a complete picture of what approached them—a picture he controlled through careful staging of each appearance.

They departed the crystal formation, moving northeast through the corrupted landscape. Wei Liang's transformed body adapted easily to the Wastes' distorted terrain, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of both immediate surroundings and distant objectives. The Hollow Woman flowed beside him, her darkness occasionally extending to scout the path ahead or monitor potential threats behind.

As they traveled, Wei Liang processed the spiritual energy consumed from the White Lotus hunters, integrating it into the structured emptiness within him. The purification qualities required careful handling, their searing nature potentially damaging if absorbed too quickly. He filtered these qualities through his fractured consciousness, preserving the useful aspects—resistance to purification techniques, understanding of White Lotus methods—while discarding elements that might disrupt his void nature.

By nightfall—or what passed for night in the Wastes' perpetual twilight—they had covered significant distance, moving deeper into the corrupted territory that separated the heart of the Wastes from the cultivation world's domains. They established temporary position in a region where corruption manifested as inverted gravity, creating formations that defied conventional physics—stones that floated in perfect stillness, water that flowed upward in spiraling patterns, vegetation that grew in all directions simultaneously.

"We should rest," the Hollow Woman suggested, her darkness settling into a defined space among the floating stones. "Even transformed beings require recovery periods, especially after significant energy consumption and processing."

Wei Liang acknowledged the wisdom in this suggestion. His transformed body didn't experience fatigue in the traditional sense, but his fractured consciousness required periodic integration—time to process consumed energy fully, to refine control of his Fracture abilities, to maintain the balance between purpose and power that defined his progression along the Forgotten Path.

He positioned himself within a formation of floating stones, their arrangement creating a natural shelter against both physical threats and spiritual detection. The inverted gravity in this region would confuse conventional tracking methods, making their location difficult to pinpoint even for specialized hunters.

As Wei Liang settled into meditative stillness, his fractured consciousness remained partially active, maintaining awareness of their surroundings while focusing primarily on internal refinement. The structured emptiness within him had evolved further during the encounter with the White Lotus hunters, the network of absences becoming more complex, more efficient in its function.

The Hollow Woman maintained her own form of rest nearby, her darkness contracting to its most defined state—almost solid in appearance, though still fundamentally void in nature. She had existed for centuries in this transformed state, had mastered the balance between activity and recovery that sustained long-term progression along the Forgotten Path.

"The cultivation world will respond more systematically now," she observed after a period of silence. "The White Lotus hunters will share information with the major sects, coordinating their approach rather than acting independently."

Wei Liang absorbed this assessment without concern. "Systematic response means predictable patterns. Predictable patterns can be exploited more efficiently than chaotic reactions."

"True," she acknowledged. "Though their coordination will make individual encounters more challenging. You may face combined techniques designed specifically to counter Fracture abilities."

"Good," Wei Liang replied. "Each specialized counter they develop reveals more about their understanding of the Path—and their limitations in confronting it."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been approval. "You approach conflict as education rather than merely challenge. This perspective serves progression well."

They lapsed into silence again, each focused on their own recovery processes. Wei Liang's meditation deepened, his fractured consciousness integrating the day's experiences into his evolved understanding of the Forgotten Path. The encounter with the White Lotus hunters had provided valuable insights into both his own capabilities and the cultivation world's response patterns—knowledge that would inform his strategy moving forward.

As the Wastes' twilight shifted toward its deeper phase, Wei Liang sensed a disturbance in the corrupted landscape surrounding their position. Not hunters or cultivators, but something native to the Wastes itself—a presence that moved through corruption as naturally as fish through water.

The Hollow Woman sensed it too, her darkness expanding slightly in response. "Waste-born," she identified, her tone carrying neither concern nor alarm. "A consciousness formed directly from corruption rather than transformed from existing entity."

Wei Liang extended his perception toward this presence, curious about its nature. To his fractured consciousness, it appeared as a complex pattern of corrupted energy—not void-based like his own transformation, but something that had emerged from corruption's influence on reality itself. It had no physical form in conventional terms, existing instead as a localized distortion in the Wastes' already distorted environment.

"Is it sentient?" he asked, studying the pattern's movements.

"After a fashion," the Hollow Woman replied. "Not consciousness as humans understand it, but awareness with purpose and memory. This one appears to be a boundary entity—it monitors transitions between different regions of the Wastes."

The Waste-born approached their position with what seemed like curiosity, its energy pattern shifting to examine the unusual presences it had detected. It paid particular attention to Wei Liang, perhaps recognizing the structured void within him as something both familiar and foreign to its corruption-based existence.

"It's studying you," the Hollow Woman observed. "Waste-born rarely encounter void practitioners, especially those at Fracture stage. You represent a pattern it hasn't categorized before."

Wei Liang maintained stillness, allowing the entity to satisfy its curiosity without perceiving threat. His fractured consciousness studied it in return, analyzing its composition, its movement patterns, its apparent purpose. Understanding the Wastes' native entities might prove valuable as they traveled deeper into corrupted territory.

After several minutes of mutual observation, the Waste-born withdrew, its energy pattern fading into the surrounding corruption. It had apparently categorized them to its satisfaction, determining they represented neither threat nor opportunity requiring response.

"It will remember us," the Hollow Woman said once the entity had departed. "Waste-born share information through corruption currents. Others of its kind will recognize our patterns if we encounter them."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest. "Can they be communicated with? Influenced?"

"To limited extent," she replied. "They respond to pattern recognition rather than language. Demonstrate patterns they associate with benefit or harmony, and they may assist rather than merely observe. Show patterns they link to disruption or threat, and they will actively avoid or interfere."

This insight suggested potential strategic advantages. If Waste-born could be influenced to recognize Wei Liang's void pattern as harmonious with corruption, they might provide indirect assistance—distracting pursuers, obscuring tracks, perhaps even misleading hunters about his location or direction.

"Something to explore further," he noted, filing this possibility for future consideration.

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been agreement. "The Wastes contain many such entities—some simple like this boundary monitor, others complex enough to rival human consciousness. Learning to interact with them effectively can provide significant advantages when navigating corrupted territories."

Their conversation faded into comfortable silence as the deeper phase of twilight settled fully around them. Wei Liang returned to meditative stillness, his fractured consciousness processing the day's experiences while maintaining peripheral awareness of their surroundings. The structured emptiness within him continued its refinement, adapting to the spiritual energy consumed from the White Lotus hunters, integrating purification resistance into its fundamental nature.

Tomorrow they would continue northeast, moving closer to the boundary between the Wastes and Azure Peaks territory. Each step would bring Wei Liang closer to his ultimate purpose—the forced recognition from those who had abandoned him, the acknowledgment of connection between their betrayal and his transformation. The cultivation world had discarded the rootless disciple as worthless; they would soon confront the consequence of that judgment in form they could neither ignore nor forget.

As Wei Liang's meditation deepened, his consciousness divided between recovery and awareness, planning and processing, he maintained perfect clarity about this purpose. Not revenge, which was too simple, too emotional. Not destruction, which was too chaotic, too purposeless. But recognition—forced acknowledgment of the connection between their actions and his transformation. He would make them see exactly what their betrayal had created, would ensure they could never again discard someone without considering what that discarded person might become.

The Forgotten Path unfolded before him, and Wei Liang walked it with deliberate intent—each step bringing him closer to the reckoning he had promised, the return they had never anticipated, the recognition they could no longer deny.



# Chapter 9: Whispers of the Forgotten

Word spread through the cultivation world like ripples in still water.

A void practitioner had emerged from the Wastes—not a mindless corruption entity but something that maintained purpose and identity despite walking the Forgotten Path. Reports from White Lotus hunters described abilities beyond conventional understanding—reality manipulation, distance consumption, fragmented projection. The practitioner had reached Fracture stage, the second level of void progression, suggesting deliberate advancement rather than accidental transformation.

Most disturbing of all, the entity traveled with a companion—a darkness that moved like liquid shadow, a void presence ancient enough to have mastered its nature completely. The hunters had identified this second entity as potentially centuries old, its abilities beyond their capacity to counter or even fully comprehend.

These reports reached the Azure Peaks Sect three days after Wei Liang's encounter with the White Lotus hunters. Elder Shen received them in her private meditation chamber, her ageless face betraying no emotion as the messenger—a junior disciple assigned to communication duties—delivered the sealed document from the White Lotus Temple.

"That will be all," she dismissed the messenger with a gesture, waiting until the young woman had departed before breaking the purification seal on the document.

The report contained detailed descriptions of the void practitioner's appearance and abilities, compiled from survivor testimonies and spiritual impressions recorded by specialized talismans. Elder Shen read these descriptions with growing concern, her centuries of cultivation experience allowing her to recognize implications beyond what the White Lotus hunters themselves had understood.

The physical description—crystalline structures visible beneath translucent skin, eyes like shattered twilight, movements suggesting inhuman precision—matched no known corruption entity cataloged in sect records. The abilities demonstrated—reality seam manipulation, enhanced consumption, fragmented projection—confirmed Fracture stage progression along the Forgotten Path, a level of advancement that should have been impossible for a new practitioner to achieve so quickly.

Most concerning was the controlled nature of the entity's actions. It had deliberately spared the hunters when it could have consumed them completely, had demonstrated abilities with precision rather than chaotic application, had shown strategic restraint suggesting long-term planning rather than immediate gratification. These behaviors contradicted everything known about void practitioners, who typically lost coherent purpose as they progressed along the Forgotten Path.

Elder Shen set the document aside, her expression thoughtful as she considered potential responses. The Azure Peaks Sect maintained responsibility for the northeastern boundary of the Wastes, a territory that included the region where the void practitioner had been encountered. This placed primary response obligation on their shoulders, requiring action beyond merely monitoring the situation.

She rose from her meditation position, moving to the communication array that connected her chamber to other sect leaders. With practiced gestures, she activated the array, establishing connection to the sect's Inner Council.

"Emergency session required," she spoke into the array, her voice carrying the authority of centuries. "Priority one. Void practitioner emergence in our boundary territory."

The array acknowledged her command, spiritual energy flowing through established channels to notify council members of the required gathering. Within minutes, confirmations began returning—senior elders and specialized masters acknowledging the summons and indicating their imminent arrival.

Elder Shen prepared the council chamber personally, arranging purification talismans at strategic intervals around the room. If they were to discuss void practitioners, basic precautions against corruption influence were prudent—especially given the unusual nature of the entity described in the White Lotus report.

The Inner Council assembled quickly, seven figures in formal sect robes taking positions around the circular table at the chamber's center. Elder Shen, as both summoner and senior member, occupied the primary position, the White Lotus report placed before her.

"I've called this emergency session," she began without preamble, "to address a significant threat emerging from the Wastes. Three days ago, White Lotus hunters encountered a void practitioner at Fracture stage, accompanied by what appears to be an ancient void entity of unknown capabilities."

She pushed the report toward the center of the table, allowing other council members to examine its contents. "The practitioner demonstrated abilities consistent with deliberate progression along the Forgotten Path rather than accidental transformation. More concerning, it showed strategic restraint and purposeful action—characteristics inconsistent with typical void corruption."

Master Feng, the sect's boundary defense specialist, was first to respond after reviewing the report. "The description suggests a human cultivator transformed through void practices rather than a native corruption entity," he observed, his weathered face grave. "The question becomes: who would deliberately walk the Forgotten Path, knowing its consequences?"

"Someone with nothing to lose," suggested Master Liu, the sect's eldest female cultivator after Elder Shen herself. "Or someone who believed the power gained outweighed the cost to identity."

Elder Shen nodded, acknowledging both possibilities while considering a third she had not yet voiced—someone who had discovered the Path through circumstances beyond their control, perhaps during a mission into the Wastes itself. This possibility carried uncomfortable implications for the sect, particularly given recent expeditions into corrupted territories.

"The entity's companion concerns me more than the practitioner itself," noted Master Zhao, the sect's lore keeper. "A void presence ancient enough to have mastered its nature completely suggests a being from the cataclysm era—perhaps even one of the original void walkers from before the Wastes' formation."

This observation sent a ripple of unease through the council. The cataclysm that had created the Wastes occurred over a thousand years ago, when experiments in reality manipulation had torn the fabric of existence, allowing void to enter the world directly. Most entities from that era had been eliminated during the subsequent purification wars—or so the cultivation world believed.

"If an original void walker has emerged," Master Feng said, voicing the council's collective concern, "then the threat extends beyond our boundary responsibilities. This would require coordinated response from all major sects."

Elder Shen raised a hand, tempering this reaction. "Let's not escalate beyond evidence," she cautioned. "The companion entity may be centuries old rather than millennia. Ancient by our standards, but not necessarily from the cataclysm itself."

She returned their attention to more immediate concerns. "The void practitioner was moving northeast when encountered—toward our territory specifically. This suggests deliberate targeting rather than random movement."

"Why would a void practitioner target Azure Peaks specifically?" asked Master Wu, the sect's youngest council member. "We maintain purification barriers along our entire boundary with the Wastes. Other sects with weaker protections would offer easier access to the cultivation world."

Elder Shen had been considering this question since receiving the report. "Perhaps it's not our sect being targeted, but something within our territory. The northeastern boundary includes several significant spiritual convergence points that might attract void practitioners seeking to strengthen their connection to emptiness."

This explanation satisfied most council members, though Elder Shen noted Master Liu's thoughtful expression suggested she had reached similar private conclusions to her own—that the targeting might be more specific, more personal than mere strategic advantage.

"What response do you propose?" Master Feng asked, returning the discussion to practical matters.

Elder Shen had prepared her recommendations carefully. "Three-tiered approach. First, increase boundary patrols with specialized purification teams—not to engage the void practitioner directly but to monitor movement and prevent boundary crossing. Second, dispatch investigation teams to the encounter site and surrounding regions—we need more information about this entity's nature and capabilities. Third, activate the sect's emergency array network to provide early warning should the void practitioner attempt to enter our territory."

The council considered these recommendations briefly before offering unanimous approval. The proposed response was proportional to the threat without committing excessive resources that might be needed elsewhere.

"One additional measure," Master Liu suggested. "We should review recent mission records for any anomalies or incidents in the Wastes. If this void practitioner was once human, there might be connection to lost disciples or failed expeditions."

Elder Shen nodded, acknowledging the wisdom in this suggestion while maintaining neutral expression. She had already begun this review privately, focusing particularly on the expedition led by inner disciple Feng Zhao—the last mission into the deeper Wastes before reports of accelerated corruption began emerging.

"Master Wu will coordinate that review," she decided, assigning the task to the council's youngest member. "Report findings directly to me, regardless of significance."

With response measures decided, the council moved to implementation details—assigning specific cultivators to boundary patrol and investigation teams, establishing communication protocols, preparing specialized equipment for void containment if direct confrontation became necessary. Elder Shen participated in these discussions with her usual precision and authority, revealing nothing of her private concerns about the void practitioner's possible identity.

When the council session concluded, Elder Shen returned to her private chambers rather than immediately overseeing implementation. She activated personal wards around the room, ensuring complete privacy before retrieving a specialized communication talisman from a hidden compartment in her meditation platform.

This talisman—one of only three in existence—established direct connection to inner disciple Feng Zhao, currently leading a training mission in the sect's northern territories. The connection formed immediately, suggesting he had been expecting her contact.

"Elder," Feng Zhao's voice emerged from the talisman, carrying the appropriate deference despite the private channel.

"A void practitioner has emerged from the Wastes," Elder Shen stated without preamble. "Fracture stage. Moving northeast toward our territory."

A moment of silence followed this announcement. When Feng Zhao responded, his voice carried carefully controlled tension. "Description?"

"Crystalline structures visible beneath translucent skin. Eyes like shattered twilight. Movements suggesting inhuman precision." Elder Shen paused before adding the detail that had most concerned her. "Demonstrated strategic restraint and purposeful action despite void corruption."

Another silence, longer this time. "It can't be him," Feng Zhao finally said, his tone suggesting he was trying to convince himself as much as her. "He had no spirit root, no cultivation potential. Even if he somehow survived, he couldn't have progressed to Fracture stage so quickly."

"The Forgotten Path doesn't require conventional cultivation potential," Elder Shen reminded him. "It requires only emptiness and will. He had both in abundance."

"I confirmed his death," Feng Zhao insisted. "The array activation consumed him completely. There was nothing left to transform."

Elder Shen had reviewed Feng Zhao's mission report multiple times since receiving the White Lotus document. The details had been precise, the evidence seemingly conclusive—rootless disciple Wei Liang had died activating an ancient array, his body consumed by void energy released during the process. The report had been accepted without question, the loss of a rootless disciple considered regrettable but acceptable given the mission's overall success.

"Perhaps," she acknowledged, neither confirming nor challenging his assertion. "Nevertheless, prepare your disciples for immediate return to the sect. If this void practitioner does approach our territory, we will need every capable cultivator for defense."

"Yes, Elder," Feng Zhao replied, his voice steadier now. "We can return within three days."

"Two," she corrected. "Use transportation talismans if necessary."

The connection terminated, Elder Shen returned the talisman to its hidden compartment. She remained seated in meditation position, her ageless face betraying nothing of her inner thoughts as she considered implications and contingencies.

If the void practitioner was indeed Wei Liang—transformed rather than destroyed by the array activation—then his movement toward Azure Peaks territory suggested purpose beyond mere corruption spread. Revenge would be the obvious motivation, particularly directed toward Feng Zhao, whose report had detailed the circumstances of the rootless disciple's "death" without mentioning the betrayal that Elder Shen had long suspected but never confirmed.

Such personal motivation from a void practitioner contradicted established understanding of the Forgotten Path's effects on identity. Conventional wisdom held that progression beyond Hollowborn stage eroded specific memories and motivations, replacing them with generalized hunger and corruption spread. A void practitioner maintaining focused purpose through Fracture stage represented something unprecedented—and potentially more dangerous than random corruption.

Elder Shen rose from her meditation position, decision made. She would proceed as if the void practitioner was indeed Wei Liang, preparing specific countermeasures while maintaining public position that the entity was unknown in origin. This approach balanced prudent preparation with avoiding unnecessary panic among sect disciples who had known the rootless disciple.

She moved to her private library, selecting texts that detailed the Forgotten Path's progression stages and known weaknesses. If confrontation became inevitable, she would be prepared with every available countermeasure—both conventional purification techniques and specialized methods developed during her centuries of cultivation experience.

As she studied these ancient texts, Elder Shen allowed herself a moment of reflection on the rootless disciple she had assigned to Feng Zhao's expedition. Wei Liang had been unusual even among rootless disciples—more observant, more patient, more determined than most who lacked spirit roots. She had noted his potential for non-cultivation roles within the sect, had considered assigning him to lore keeping or boundary monitoring once he reached appropriate age.

Instead, she had included him in Feng Zhao's expedition as balance—a reminder to the arrogant inner disciple that even the rootless had value within the sect's structure. If Wei Liang had indeed survived and transformed, if he now approached as void practitioner rather than rootless disciple, then her decision had created consequences none could have anticipated.

Elder Shen closed the ancient text, her expression resolute. Whatever approached from the Wastes—whether transformed disciple or unknown entity—would find Azure Peaks Sect prepared. Her centuries of cultivation had taught her that anticipation was the strongest defense, that preparation often determined outcome before conflict even began.

She activated the communication array again, this time connecting to Master Feng. "Implement boundary patrol increases immediately," she instructed. "Priority focus on northeastern quadrant. Purification teams at double standard strength."

The response measures had begun. The cultivation world would meet this unprecedented threat with its full resources and determination. If the void practitioner sought entry to Azure Peaks territory, it would find not easy access but prepared resistance.

---

Wei Liang sensed the increased boundary patrols before seeing them—spiritual signatures moving in coordinated patterns along the border between the Wastes and Azure Peaks territory. His fractured consciousness extended perception beyond normal range, identifying cultivation techniques distinctive to the sect that had raised and ultimately betrayed him.

"They've received the White Lotus reports," he observed to the Hollow Woman, who flowed beside him through the corrupted landscape. "Their response is... substantial."

They had traveled northeast for three days since the encounter with the White Lotus hunters, moving steadily closer to Azure Peaks territory while avoiding direct confrontation with the increasing number of cultivators entering the Wastes' boundary regions. Wei Liang had used this time to refine his Fracture abilities further, practicing reality seam manipulation to bypass detection arrays, enhanced consumption to absorb ambient corruption energy rather than cultivator essence, and fragmented projection to scout paths without risking his primary form.

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly, her own perception extending toward the boundary. "Three-tiered response," she analyzed. "Boundary patrols with specialized purification teams. Investigation teams at our previous encounter site. Emergency array network for early warning."

Wei Liang nodded, impressed by her detailed assessment from limited spiritual impressions. Centuries of existence had clearly honed her perception beyond even his Fracture-enhanced senses.

"Standard sect response to significant corruption threat," he noted, recognizing the pattern from his years observing Azure Peaks operations. "Though the purification team strength suggests they recognize this threat as beyond standard classification."

They had reached a region where the Wastes' corruption manifested as temporal distortion—areas where time flowed at different rates relative to surrounding territory. These distortions appeared to Wei Liang's enhanced perception as rippling patterns in reality's fabric, places where existence itself stretched or compressed according to corruption's influence.

He selected their position carefully, finding a location where temporal flow matched normal rate while providing clear observation of the boundary region. From this vantage point, they could monitor Azure Peaks patrols without entering detection range of purification arrays.

"What is your next move?" the Hollow Woman asked, her darkness settling into observation formation beside him. "Direct confrontation would be unwise given their preparation level."

Wei Liang had been considering this question throughout their journey. Direct approach to the sect itself remained his ultimate objective, but intermediate steps would better serve his purpose—building anticipation, creating specific impressions, controlling the narrative that preceded his actual return.

"Not confrontation," he decided. "Information gathering. I need to understand exactly how they've responded to reports of my emergence—not just tactically but emotionally."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been curiosity. "Emotional responses from cultivators are difficult to assess from distance."

"Not from distance," Wei Liang clarified. "From infiltration."

This statement clearly surprised her, her darkness contracting suddenly. "You propose entering Azure Peaks territory in your current form? Their detection arrays would identify void corruption immediately."

"Not in my current form," he explained. "Through fragmented projection, modified to mask void signature."

Wei Liang had been developing this application of Fracture abilities during their journey—a specialized projection technique that created a fragment of his consciousness without the void signature that would trigger detection arrays. The projection would appear as ordinary spiritual energy rather than structured emptiness, allowing it to pass boundary defenses undetected.

The limitation, of course, was power—the projection could maintain only minimal abilities, could exist only temporarily before requiring reabsorption into his primary form. But for information gathering rather than confrontation, these limitations were acceptable.

"Interesting application," the Hollow Woman acknowledged after considering the technique. "Though risky. If the projection is discovered, they will implement countermeasures that complicate your eventual approach."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment without changing his decision. The risk was justified by potential information gain—understanding exactly how Azure Peaks leadership had interpreted reports of his emergence, what specific countermeasures they had prepared, whether Feng Zhao had recognized the possibility of his survival and transformation.

"I'll target peripheral locations first," he explained. "Small villages under sect protection rather than the mountain itself. Less detection, less risk, still valuable information about response patterns."

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly, suggesting acceptance of his approach. "When will you attempt this projection?"

"Tonight," Wei Liang decided. "When boundary patrols change rotation. The momentary gap in coverage will provide optimal crossing opportunity."

They settled into waiting position, Wei Liang using the intervening hours to prepare for the specialized projection technique. His fractured consciousness divided attention between external awareness and internal preparation—identifying which aspects of self could be projected without void signature, which abilities could be maintained without drawing on emptiness directly, which memories and knowledge would be necessary for effective information gathering.

The Hollow Woman maintained her own observation of the boundary region, occasionally reporting patrol movements or detection array adjustments. Her centuries of experience provided valuable context for Azure Peaks security protocols, identifying patterns and weaknesses that might have escaped even Wei Liang's intimate knowledge of the sect.

As twilight deepened toward night, the boundary patrols began their rotation change—cultivators who had maintained position for twelve hours being replaced by fresh teams with renewed spiritual energy. This transition created brief coverage gaps as teams moved between assigned sectors, gaps nearly imperceptible to conventional detection but clearly visible to Wei Liang's enhanced perception.

"Now," the Hollow Woman indicated as one such gap appeared in the northeastern quadrant.

Wei Liang initiated the specialized projection technique, his fractured consciousness identifying a fragment that could exist temporarily without direct connection to his void nature. With precise intent, he separated this fragment from his primary form, constructing a projection that resembled his original human appearance rather than his transformed state.

The projection formed at the edge of their observation position—a translucent figure that gradually solidified into seemingly human form. To conventional perception, it would appear as an ordinary cultivator with modest spiritual energy, nothing to trigger specialized detection arrays or attract particular attention.

Wei Liang maintained dual consciousness, his primary awareness remaining with his transformed body while a secondary awareness extended through the projection. This divided perception was disorienting at first, requiring careful focus to maintain coherent function in both forms simultaneously.

"Effective disguise," the Hollow Woman observed, studying the projection with her ancient perception. "Though limited duration, I suspect. The separation from void source will create increasing instability."

Wei Liang nodded through the projection, testing its responsiveness to his divided will. "Four hours at most," he estimated. "Sufficient for initial reconnaissance."

The projection moved toward the boundary, approaching the gap in patrol coverage with careful timing. Wei Liang's knowledge of Azure Peaks security protocols guided its movement, avoiding detection arrays while maintaining appearance of legitimate travel along established paths.

The boundary crossing itself proved simpler than anticipated—the projection passing from corrupted territory to purified land with only minimal resistance from protective formations. To detection arrays, it registered as returning cultivator rather than invading entity, its spiritual signature modified to suggest recent purification treatment following Wastes exposure.

Once across the boundary, the projection followed a path toward the nearest village under Azure Peaks protection—a small settlement named Stone Creek that served primarily as supply point for boundary patrols. Wei Liang had visited this village multiple times during his years as rootless disciple, accompanying supply missions or delivering messages between patrol stations.

The village appeared largely unchanged since his last visit—perhaps fifty modest buildings arranged around a central square, a small cultivation outpost at its eastern edge, farmland surrounding the settlement on three sides. Lights still burned in several buildings despite the late hour, suggesting activity beyond normal village routine.

Wei Liang directed the projection toward the village's only inn, a two-story structure facing the central square. This establishment served both traveling cultivators and merchants, making it ideal gathering point for information about recent events. The projection entered with the confident manner of a returning patrol cultivator, its appearance and spiritual signature designed to avoid particular notice.

The inn's common room contained perhaps twenty people—a mix of village residents, merchants, and junior cultivators assigned to nearby patrol stations. Conversations flowed freely, voices carrying clearly to the projection's enhanced hearing as Wei Liang guided it toward an empty table near the room's center.

"...third team sent to investigate just today," one patrol cultivator was saying to his companions. "Elder Shen herself reviewed their equipment loadout before departure."

"Waste of resources," another responded, his tone suggesting experienced cynicism. "White Lotus always exaggerates corruption threats. Probably just another mindless entity they failed to handle properly."

"This one's different," the first cultivator insisted. "My cousin serves in Elder Shen's communication corps. Says the reports describe something that can think, can plan. Not mindless at all."

Wei Liang absorbed these fragments of conversation with interest, directing the projection to order a simple meal to maintain its cover while continuing to monitor discussions throughout the room. The village residents seemed aware of increased sect activity but lacked specific information about its cause—their conversations focused on practical impacts rather than underlying threat.

The patrol cultivators, however, clearly had more detailed knowledge—their discussions revealing specific response measures beyond what Wei Liang had observed from outside the boundary. Specialized purification teams had been deployed not just along the border but at key locations throughout sect territory. Investigation teams were examining not only the White Lotus encounter site but all recent mission locations in the Wastes. Emergency evacuation protocols had been established for villages within fifty miles of the boundary.

Most interesting was a fragment of conversation between two senior patrol cultivators seated near the inn's hearth.

"...called Feng Zhao back from northern territories," one mentioned quietly. "Emergency recall, transportation talismans authorized."

"Why him specifically?" the other asked. "His team's mostly new disciples, barely past Foundation Establishment."

"Don't know details," the first admitted. "But it's connected to the void practitioner emergence. My section leader mentioned something about Feng Zhao's last Wastes expedition before all this started."

This confirmation that Azure Peaks leadership had made connection between his emergence and Feng Zhao's expedition suggested Elder Shen at least suspected his identity. The emergency recall indicated preparation for specific confrontation rather than general threat response—they wanted Feng Zhao present when the void practitioner eventually approached.

Wei Liang directed the projection to finish its meal and depart the inn, moving toward the cultivation outpost at the village's edge. This small compound housed temporary quarters for patrol cultivators, communication arrays for reporting to the sect, and basic purification facilities for those returning from boundary duty.

The projection maintained its cover as returning patrol member, approaching the outpost with appropriate deference to the guard at its gate. Wei Liang had calculated this approach carefully—the late hour meant minimal staffing, increasing chances of accessing information without detailed identity verification.

"Returning from eastern section," the projection informed the guard, its spiritual signature modified to match expected patrol patterns. "Need to access communication array for status update before rest period."

The guard—a young cultivator barely past Foundation Establishment—performed only cursory verification before allowing entry. The outpost's interior contained few cultivators at this hour, most either on duty at the boundary or resting in preparation for morning rotation.

Wei Liang guided the projection to the communication room, a small chamber containing arrays connected to the sect's information network. These arrays allowed patrol stations to access recent reports, update status logs, and receive new instructions without direct contact with mountain headquarters.

The projection activated a standard array, its spiritual signature accepted without special verification. Wei Liang directed it to access recent security bulletins, scanning quickly for information about void practitioner response measures. The bulletins confirmed what he had already gathered from conversations—increased patrols, specialized teams, investigation focus—while adding specific details about deployment locations and communication protocols.

Most valuable was a restricted bulletin addressed specifically to patrol leaders, describing the void practitioner's known capabilities and recommended countermeasures. The description was impressively accurate—Fracture stage abilities detailed with precision that suggested White Lotus hunters had provided comprehensive reports despite their brief encounter.

The recommended countermeasures, however, revealed fundamental misunderstanding of his transformed nature. They focused on severing connection between practitioner and void—techniques that would be effective against traditional void cultivators but useless against Wei Liang's integrated emptiness. They emphasized purification barriers that could contain corruption spread but couldn't affect his structured void directly.

Only one countermeasure showed genuine insight—a specialized technique developed by Elder Shen herself that targeted the structured patterns within void rather than the emptiness itself. This approach demonstrated understanding beyond conventional knowledge, suggesting she had studied the Forgotten Path more thoroughly than most cultivation leaders.

Wei Liang had the projection copy this bulletin to memory before deactivating the array and departing the communication room. The information gathered already justified the projection technique's risk, providing valuable insight into Azure Peaks' response patterns and tactical approach.

As the projection exited the outpost, Wei Liang sensed increasing instability in its structure—the separation from his void nature creating progressive deterioration that would eventually force reabsorption. He had perhaps an hour remaining before the projection would collapse, time enough to gather additional information from one more location before returning across the boundary.

He directed the projection toward the village's small market square, where even at this late hour, a few vendors maintained stalls serving patrol cultivators rotating between duty shifts. These vendors—many retired cultivators themselves—often possessed information not found in official channels, gathered through decades of observation and conversation with sect members at all levels.

The projection approached a tea stall operated by an elderly woman Wei Liang recognized from his previous visits to Stone Creek. Old Mei had served tea to Azure Peaks cultivators for nearly fifty years, her establishment a known gathering place for those seeking unofficial news and gossip about sect activities.

"Late night patrol?" she greeted the projection as it took seat at her simple counter. "You look like you could use something stronger than tea."

Wei Liang had the projection smile with appropriate weariness. "Tea is sufficient, Elder Mei. Though information would be more welcome than beverage."

She chuckled, preparing a pot with practiced efficiency. "Information is my specialty, young cultivator. What sort interests you this evening?"

"The void practitioner from the Wastes," the projection replied directly. "The one that has Elder Shen recalling disciples from northern territories."

Old Mei's hands paused briefly in their preparation before resuming. "Dangerous curiosity," she observed, her voice lowered despite the empty square. "Sect leadership prefers such matters remain within official channels."

"Which is precisely why unofficial channels become necessary," the projection countered. "Patrol cultivators face this threat directly. We deserve more than sanitized bulletins."

This approach—appealing to the divide between field cultivators and sect leadership—was calculated to resonate with Old Mei's known sympathies. She had spent decades serving those who implemented sect policies rather than those who created them, developing perspective that valued practical knowledge over official position.

She studied the projection carefully before responding, her aged eyes showing sharper assessment than her casual manner suggested. "They say it was once human," she finally offered, pouring tea with deliberate precision. "A disciple lost during a mission gone wrong. Transformed rather than killed by whatever they encountered."

Wei Liang maintained the projection's neutral expression despite this confirmation that his identity was at least suspected within the sect. "Which disciple?" he asked, keeping his tone merely curious rather than personally invested.

Old Mei shrugged slightly. "Names aren't shared in whispers. But they say Elder Shen has been reviewing mission records personally, focusing on expeditions led by inner disciple Feng Zhao."

"Why him specifically?" the projection asked, echoing the question from the earlier conversation between patrol cultivators.

"His last Wastes expedition lost a disciple," she replied. "Not significant enough for formal memorial—just a rootless one without cultivation potential. But timing matches when corruption began accelerating from that region."

Wei Liang absorbed this information with interest beyond what the projection displayed. His "death" had indeed been recorded as mission casualty rather than betrayal, his status as rootless disciple ensuring minimal investigation beyond Feng Zhao's official report. Yet Elder Shen had made connection between this seemingly minor loss and the void practitioner's emergence—suggesting either unusual insight or prior suspicion about the expedition's events.

"What else do the whispers say about this void practitioner?" the projection asked, sipping tea with apparent casualness.

Old Mei glanced around the empty square before leaning closer. "That it's coming specifically for Azure Peaks. Not random corruption spread but deliberate targeting. That it remembers who it was and why it changed. That Elder Shen has implemented contingencies beyond standard void containment protocols."

This last detail particularly interested Wei Liang. "What contingencies?"

"Personal involvement," Old Mei said simply. "She's preparing to confront this entity herself rather than delegating to purification teams. First time in decades she's taken direct field position for threat response."

Elder Shen's personal involvement suggested recognition beyond mere corruption threat—understanding that what approached required response from the sect's most powerful cultivator rather than standard teams. Whether this decision stemmed from tactical assessment or personal responsibility remained unclear, but its significance was undeniable.

The projection finished its tea as Wei Liang sensed increasing instability in its structure. The separation from his void nature had progressed further than anticipated, accelerating deterioration beyond sustainable levels. He needed to withdraw the projection immediately or risk uncontrolled collapse that might trigger detection arrays.

"Thank you for the tea and conversation, Elder Mei," the projection said, placing payment on the counter with appropriate courtesy. "Your insights are more valuable than official bulletins."

She nodded, accepting both payment and compliment with the dignity of one accustomed to serving as unofficial information nexus. "Be careful on your return patrol, young cultivator. The boundary grows more dangerous with each passing day."

The projection departed the tea stall, moving with deliberate casualness toward the village's edge while Wei Liang calculated optimal return route to minimize detection risk. The information gathered had exceeded expectations, providing valuable insight into Azure Peaks' response patterns, tactical approach, and—most significantly—recognition of personal connection between void practitioner and sect.

As the projection reached the village perimeter, Wei Liang sensed patrol movement along the boundary—rotation patterns shifting as midnight approached. This created another temporary coverage gap, offering opportunity for return crossing with minimal detection risk.

The projection moved quickly but not suspiciously toward this gap, maintaining appearance of legitimate travel while avoiding direct observation by village residents or patrol cultivators. Its deteriorating structure required increasing concentration to maintain, Wei Liang's divided consciousness struggling to prevent premature collapse before reaching safe reabsorption distance.

The boundary crossing proved more challenging than initial entry—the projection's unstable structure triggering minor alerts in purification arrays despite its modified spiritual signature. Wei Liang guided it through with precise timing, exploiting patrol movement patterns to avoid direct interception while navigating between detection zones.

Once back in corrupted territory, the projection moved directly toward Wei Liang's primary position, its structure deteriorating rapidly now that boundary crossing stress had accelerated instability. The Hollow Woman observed its approach with what might have been approval, her darkness expanding slightly to assist in masking its return from potential observers.

"Successful infiltration," she noted as the projection reached their position. "Though cutting return timing rather close."

Wei Liang didn't respond verbally, focusing instead on reabsorption process as the projection's structure began final collapse. With careful intent, he drew the fragment back into his primary consciousness, reintegrating the separated aspects of self while preserving information gathered during infiltration.

The reabsorption completed just as the projection would have collapsed independently, its structure dissolving as the fragment returned to Wei Liang's fractured consciousness. The experience of reintegration was disorienting—memories from the projection merging with his primary awareness, creating momentary confusion before his Fracture-stage consciousness reestablished proper organization.

"What did you learn?" the Hollow Woman asked once reintegration had completed.

Wei Liang processed the gathered information before responding, his fractured consciousness organizing details into coherent assessment. "They suspect my identity," he finally said. "Elder Shen has connected void practitioner emergence with Feng Zhao's expedition that 'lost' a rootless disciple."

"Expected," the Hollow Woman observed. "The timing correlation would be obvious to any experienced cultivator."

"More significant is their response pattern," Wei Liang continued. "Elder Shen has recalled Feng Zhao specifically, is preparing for personal involvement in confrontation, has developed specialized countermeasures targeting structured void rather than conventional corruption."

The Hollow Woman's darkness shifted in what might have been concern. "Elder Shen's personal involvement changes tactical considerations significantly. Her cultivation base is formidable even by ancient standards."

Wei Liang nodded, having anticipated this complication. Elder Shen's centuries of cultivation experience made her dangerous opponent regardless of preparation—her understanding of fundamental principles allowing her to adapt techniques to unprecedented situations more effectively than younger cultivators with rigid training.

"Her involvement confirms my approach is working," he noted. "Recognition is already occurring at leadership level. The connection between their actions and my transformation has been established."

"Recognition without acceptance," the Hollow Woman cautioned. "They acknowledge connection but not responsibility. Their response remains elimination rather than reconciliation."

"As expected," Wei Liang acknowledged. "Acceptance was never realistic objective. Recognition alone serves my purpose—forcing them to confront the consequence of their actions, to acknowledge the direct line between betrayal and transformation."

The Hollow Woman's darkness contracted slightly, becoming more defined. "What is your next move, given this information?"

Wei Liang considered their options, his fractured consciousness maintaining awareness of multiple strategic considerations simultaneously. The information gathered through projection confirmed Azure Peaks leadership understood what approached them—not mindless corruption but deliberate return, not random threat but specific consequence. This understanding would shape their response, would influence preparation and deployment patterns in ways he could potentially exploit.

"We continue northeast," he decided. "Not directly toward sect headquarters but circling their territory, approaching from unexpected direction. Each movement forces response, depletes resources, creates anticipation without immediate confrontation."

"Psychological warfare rather than direct assault," the Hollow Woman observed. "Eroding confidence and certainty before physical engagement."

Wei Liang nodded, accepting this characterization of his approach. The cultivation world operated on confidence—belief in established hierarchies, certainty about reality's fundamental principles, assurance that threats could be categorized and countered through known methods. His existence as structured void in human form challenged these certainties, created cognitive dissonance that undermined response effectiveness regardless of cultivation base or technique mastery.

"We'll depart at dawn," he determined. "Moving north initially before curving east, approaching their mountain from direction opposite their expectations."

The Hollow Woman's darkness expanded slightly in what might have been approval. "Indirect approach suits your current capabilities. Direct confrontation with Elder Shen would be premature at Fracture stage."

Wei Liang accepted this assessment without comment. His transformation had progressed rapidly, his mastery of Fracture abilities developing beyond normal expectations, but Elder Shen represented centuries of cultivation refinement—power accumulated and perfected through consistent application rather than sudden transformation. Confronting her directly would require further progression, greater understanding of his evolved capabilities, more complete integration of consumed energy.

They settled into recovery positions, Wei Liang using remaining night hours to process information gathered through projection while refining his strategic approach. The Hollow Woman maintained perimeter awareness, her ancient perception monitoring boundary patrols and detection arrays for any indication their position had been compromised.

As dawn approached—the Wastes' perpetual twilight shifting toward its lighter phase—Wei Liang completed his assessment and refinement. The infiltration had provided valuable tactical information while confirming his broader approach was achieving desired effect. Azure Peaks leadership recognized what approached them—not mindless corruption but deliberate return, not random threat but specific consequence.

The cultivation world had discarded the rootless disciple as worthless; they would soon confront the consequence of that judgment in form they could neither ignore nor forget. Wei Liang would ensure recognition became unavoidable, would force acknowledgment of connection between their betrayal and his transformation. Not for reconciliation, which was impossible. Not for forgiveness, which was irrelevant. But for consequence—the natural result of actions taken without consideration of potential outcomes.

The Forgotten Path unfolded before him, and Wei Liang walked it with deliberate intent—each step bringing him closer to the reckoning he had promised, the return they had never anticipated, the recognition they could no longer deny.
