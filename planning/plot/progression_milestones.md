# Progression Milestones: The Forgotten Path

## Overview

The protagonist's journey along the Forgotten Path forms the core progression system of the narrative. Unlike traditional cultivation paths that build and refine, the Forgotten Path consumes and corrupts, with each advancement requiring sacrifice and fundamentally changing Wei Liang. This document outlines the specific stages, their manifestations, and their narrative significance.

## Thematic Significance

Each stage of the Forgotten Path represents not just an increase in power but a thematic development:

- **Hollowborn**: Represents the emptying of self required to begin transformation

- **Void**: Embodies the negation of established order and systems
- **Unmaker**: Represents the power to corrupt and transform reality itself
- **The Nameless**: Symbolizes the ultimate transcendence through complete self-erasure

The progression system thus serves as both literal power advancement and metaphorical journey through the novel's core themes of identity, power, and transformation through destruction.
